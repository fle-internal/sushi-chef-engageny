The Sound Cards represent the spellings that stand for sounds. The Sound Cards should be posted to the empty boxes under the target sound on the Sound Posters as spellings are taught. As you teach the lessons in the program you will be continually affixing Sound Posters and Sound Cards to your walls. When you complete the entire kindergarten program, you will have displayed 51 sound cards with their appropriate target sounds on Sound Posters. Each time a new letter-sound correspondence is taught, the Teacher Guide will remind you to display the Sound Poster and the Sound Card.\u00a0 Kindergarten: Skills Sound Posters \tThese Sound Posters will be used in conjunction with the Sound Cards in Units 3\u20135, 7\u20138, and 10 of the Kindergarten Skills strand, as indicated in each of these units\u2019 respective Teacher Guides. The Sound Posters are intended to be posted on the walls of the classroom as you teach letter-sound correspondences. They provide a visual reminder of the code knowledge students have been taught, and are a very useful reference for spelling and writing. Each poster has a target sound printed in a speech bubble at the top of the poster, and one box for each spelling taught in kindergarten. These boxes will be filled with Sound Cards, which each represent a spelling for the target sound. As you teach the lessons in the program you will be continually affixing Sound Posters and Sound Cards to your walls. When you complete the entire kindergarten program, you will have displayed 10 vowel posters and 25 consonant posters. Each time a new letter-sound correspondence is taught, the Teacher Guide will remind you to display the Sound Poster and the Sound Card.

Students will arrange Small Letter Cards on their Chaining Folders. When using the chaining folders, you will ask students to spell a word on their Chaining Folders, check their work, spell the word on your pocket chart, and have students practice procedures to check spelling accuracy.

When using the chaining folders, you will ask students to spell a word on their Chaining Folders, check their work, spell the word on your pocket chart, and have students practice procedures to check spelling accuracy. Kindergarten: Skills Large Letter Card Set \tThe Large Letter Card Set will be used in Units 3\u201310 of the Kindergarten Skills strand, for Large Card chaining exercises as indicated in each of these units\u2019 respective Teacher Guides. In Large Card Chaining, each student is given a single Large Card with a single- or multi-letter spelling printed on it. The teacher says a word and students arrange themselves to spell the word. This helps students to practice phonemic spelling while offering students the opportunity to move around. By the end of kindergarten, students will have practiced chaining using 42 different Large Cards. Kindergarten: Skills Blending Picture Cards \tThe Blending Picture Cards, consisting of 40 color pictures of objects and items, are used exclusively in Unit 2 of the Kindergarten Skills strand. The pictures can be used as visual cues to help students blend names of objects and items. These names consist of either two or three sounds and are therefore suitable for early blending practice.

The teacher will then present a second reading during which the teacher draws attention to spelling and grammar, and then asks students to answer a number of discussion questions. In the remaining lessons, the teacher will present the stories initally as demonstration stories; then the teacher will ask students to read the stories independently in their readers. These stories are 100% decodable, meaning students should be able to read all of the words via blending. Stories grow in length and complexity throughout the reader as students learn more letter-sound correspondences and augment their decoding skills.",

By the end of this unit, students will be able to: 1. With prompting and support, ask and answer questions (e.g., who, what, where, when) requiring literal recall and understanding of the details and/or facts of a fiction text; \t2. With prompting and support, use narrative language to describe characters, setting, things, events, actions, a scene, or facts from a fiction text that has been read independently; \t3. With prompting and support, describe illustrations from a fiction text read independently, using the illustrations to check and support comprehension of the story; \t4. Read aloud in a group, with a partner, or alone at least 15 minutes each day; \t5. Demonstrate understanding of basic print conventions by tracking and following print word for word when listening to a text read aloud; \t6. Demonstrate understanding that a systematic, predictable relationship exists between written letters and spoken sounds; \t7. Recognize and name the 26 letters of the alphabet in their lowercase forms; \t8. Segment a spoken word into phonemes, e.g., given bat, produce the segments /b/ /a/ /t/; \t9. Identify whether pairs of phonemes are the same or different, including pairs that differ only in voicing, e.g., /b/ and /p/; \t10.

By the end of this unit, students will be able to: \t1. With prompting and support, ask and answer questions (e.g., who, what, where, when) requiring literal recall and understanding of the details and/or facts of a fiction text; \t2. With prompting and support, use narrative language to describe characters, setting, things, events, actions, a scene, or facts from a fiction text that has been read independently; \t3. Read aloud in a group, with a partner, or alone at least 15 minutes each day; \t4. Segment a spoken word into phonemes (e.g., given bat, produce the segments /b/ /a/ /t/); \t5. Identify whether pairs of phonemes are the same or different, including pairs that differ only in voicing (e.g., /b/ and /p/); \t6. Indicate whether a target phoneme is present in the initial/medial/final position of a spoken word (e.g., hear /m/ at the beginning of mat and /g/ at the end of bag); \t7. Orally blend sounds to form words (e.g., given the sounds /k/\u2026/a/\u2026/t/, blend to make cat); \t8. Read and write any one-syllable short vowel CVC words (e.g., sit, cat, wet, not, cup); \t9. Begin to read and write one-syllable words containing a long vowel sound with the final \u2013e spelling (e.g., late, bite, note, and cute); \t10. Read, spell, and/or write chains of one-syllable short vowel words in which one sound is added, substituted, or omitted (e.g., at > bat > bad > bid); \t11. Read, spell, and write chains of one-syllable short vowel words with consonant blends/clusters and/or consonant digraphs (e.g., stab > slab > slap > slash); \t12. Read, spell, and write chains of one-syllable long vowel words with the final \u2013e spelling (e.g., nine > line > lime > time > tame > came > cape > tape); \t13. Read high-frequency words identified as Tricky Words: he, she, we, be, me, they, their, my, by, you, your; \t14. Read decodable text that incorporates the letter-sound correspondences that have been taught, with purpose and understanding; \t15. Use phonics skills in conjunction with context to confirm or self-correct word recognition and understanding, rereading as necessary; and \t16. Spell and write any CVC, CCVC, CVCC, or CCVCC word that uses letter-sound correspondences taught in kindergarten.",

As students learn or review code knowledge, they are asked to use markers to trace over the sound spellings to acknowledge learning them. By the end of Grade 2, students will have traced over all of the sound spellings in the Individual Code Charts. These charts are a good way for students to have at their hands a guide to help them remember what they have learned.

They will use information about their individual strengths and needs as readers to set goals for the development of their reading powers, and will write a text-based informational paragraph about their goals.

Students do NOT do a close reading of this text; instead, they spend time in class practicing reading stamina with their independent reading book. This lesson reminds students of the importance of reading a high volume of books at their own reading level. This proves particularly helpful to building student reading fluency and the academic vocabulary that the CCLS demands. See the Unit 2 Recommended Texts lists for books at various Lexile ranges related to the topic of this unit.",

Use professional judgment if some students simply will not succeed with a text at the official grade-level Lexile band. This lesson serves two purposes. First, students can practice for their assessment; and, second, it might provide an idea for a service project to do as an extension of this unit: reading aloud and creating audio recordings of books or poems, to then share with younger children or others.

Through a study of Bullfrog at Magnolia Circle (by Deborah Dennard, illustrated by Kristin Kest), students will practice close reading and listening to informational texts, generating questions, building vocabulary, and locating information in text as they learn about the bullfrog (a \u201ctrue\u201d frog). In the on-demand mid-unit assessment, students will demonstrate their skill in answering and asking questions as they close read a new passage from Bullfrog at Magnolia Circle. Students will communicate their learning through note-taking, Science Talks, and writing. This unit provides the class with initial exposure to key scientific concepts regarding adaptations, habitat, predators and prey, and the physical characteristics of frogs, which students will build on during Unit 2. Students will demonstrate their growing expertise in the end of unit ondemand assessment, in which they write an informational paragraph that synthesizes their learning about the bullfrog.",

Class members will extend their expertise beyond the bullfrog and begin studying \"freaky frogs\": frogs with unusual behavioral and physical adaptations. Students will build their ability to read and understand informational text. The class begins the unit by building basic background knowledge about adaptations as well as learning more about how to use features of informational text when learning about a topic. They read key sections from the central text Everything You Need to Know about Frogs and other Slippery Creatures, to build their expertise about frogs' life cycle, habitat, and the physical characteristics that make some frogs particularly \"freaky.\" Students will be supported to pay particular attention to key vocabulary each day, and will begin a vocabulary notebook. For a mid-unit assessment students will demonstrate their reading skills through reading a new text about a different species of frog, the spadefoot toad. Next, students will continue with the same central text and build their knowledge by studying three different kinds of freaky frogs: the glass frog, the Amazon horned frog and the water-holding frog. These lessons also will incorporate a routine of reading poetry about frogs to build students' reading fluency. Students then go into more depth about one specific freaky frog, comparing and contrasting how two different authors present information about a particularly intriguing frog: the poison dart frog. As an end of unit assessment, students will write an on-demand paragraph about the poison dart frog, using the expertise they built and drawing from their learning in Unit 1 about vivid and precise language.",

The specific literacy focus of this unit is on writing first-person narratives using vivid and precise language, as well as continuing to learn to revise and critique. Each student will create a Freaky Frog Trading Card to amaze their readers about the unique, sometimes freaky, adaptations of frogs. This writing serves as a synthesis of the research students did in Units 1 and 2, and students will incorporate many of the rich words about frogs and adaptations they have learned throughout the module. The front side of the card will include a collection of basic frog facts collected through their research as well as a digital picture of their freaky frog. The other side of the card will be a research-based narrative paragraph about one category of their freaky frog (e.g., habitat, life cycle). In the first part of this unit, students will deepen their expertise about the freaky frogs they learned about in Unit 2, reading an additional resource. Students also will participate in a Science Talk to help them synthesize their learning about how the adaptations of their freaky frogs help it survive. Students then plan, draft, and revise both sides of their freaky frog trading cards. They will practice revising and editing their writing based on critique from peers and the teacher, and will publish and share their trading cards with peers (and maybe even at a local nature center!). After finishing their trading cards, students will complete the on-demand end of unit assessment: they will focus on the same freaky frog, but choose a different category from their frog matrix recording form.",

This focus on research intentionally builds on Module 1, in which students explored the superpowers of reading. Specifically, students will seek evidence of culture, which can be thought of as the story of a group of people constructed through the generations; it can be evidenced through ancient and modern-day customs and traditions. The module will begin with a class study of the culture of Japan: Students will read Magic Tree House: Dragon of the Red Dawn, a book set in ancient Japan, paired with Exploring Countries: Japan, an informational text about modern Japan. Unit 2 follows a similar pattern, but students work with increasing independence. They will form book clubs to build expertise on a different country\u2014reading a new Magic Tree House book set in their selected country, paired with a new Exploring Countries informational text to learn about that country\u2019s culture. Students expand their definition of culture to include more than just customs and traditions In Unit 3, students will demonstrate their expertise about how customs and traditions help us learn about culture by writing a research-based letter to Magic Tree House author Mary Pope Osborne that informs Ms. Osborne of customs and traditions that have endured in a culture from ancient to modern time.

              "description": "In Unit 2, students will look at Peter Pan through the lens of a writer. They will examine the author\u2019s craft, specifically the use of dialogue and how the author uses vivid language to describe action. Students will then write their own imagined scene about Peter Pan, using their choice of two prompts. In the mid-unit assessment, students will write an on-demand imagined scene from a new prompt, applying their writing skills to a new scene. This assessment mirrors the writing instruction in this unit and asks students to apply those skills independently. The mid-unit assessment addresses their ability to craft a narrative scene. The prompt for the assessment requires students to connect to their reading and apply their knowledge of the character\u2019s motivations, feelings, and actions to help them imagine and write their scene. This is a writing assessment and is not intended to assess their reading of Peter Pan. Rather, they draw on their experiences reading and writing about Peter Pan to support their on-demand writing. This narrative writing task centers on NYSP12 ELA Standard W.3.3 In the second half of Unit 2, students continue to consider how authors capture readers\u2019 imaginations by reading and performing Readers Theater. They turn their attention to specific scenes of a script based on J.M. Barrie\u2019s original 1904 play\u2014Peter Pan; or The Boy Who Wouldn\u2019t Grow Up\u2014and compare those to scenes from their edition of Peter Pan. Students also will build fluency through Readers Theater, reading aloud and re-enacting excerpts from the Peter Pan script. (As an extension, students may perform their Readers Theater scenes for a real audience.) The End of Unit 2 Assessment has two parts. In Part 1, students read a script, analyzing it to plan for how they will deliver their lines. In Part 2, students perform their lines of a dialogue as a fluency assessment (while the teacher reads the other part and stage directions). The end of unit assessment centers on NYSP12 ELA Standards RL.3.3 and RF.3.4.",

Students first will practice summary writing and write a brief summary of the Classic Starts edition of Peter Pan. In the mid-unit assessment, students will apply their summary writing skills by writing an on-demand summary of a familiar story: Waiting for the Biblioburro, used in Module 1. This assessment centers on NYSP12 ELA standards RL 3.2, W3.2, and W.3.4. Next, students will consider the module\u2019s guiding question: \u201cHow do writers capture a reader\u2019s imagination?\u201d and craft an opinion piece about their favorite Peter Pan character. Students will build on their skills as opinion writers from Unit 1 by supporting their reasons with specific\u00a0examples from the story. Students will engage in the writing process of planning, drafting, and revising their work with this two-part performance task (summary and opinion). They will give and receive feedback about their writing through structured critique protocols to strengthen their writing. This two-part performance task (summary and opinion) centers on PK12 NYS ELA standards: RL.3.2, RL.3.3, R.L.3.5, W.3.1, W.3.2, W.3.4, W.3.5, L.3.1, L.3.2, and L.3.3. In the end of unit assessment, students will apply their opinion writing skills by writing about a second character from the Classic Starts edition of Peter Pan. This assessment centers on W.3.1, W.3.4, and L.3.2.",

              "description": "In this unit, students build their background knowledge about where water is found on earth and the movement of water through the water cycle and the physical landscape. Students will consider the guiding question \u201cWhere does our water come from?\u201d as they begin reading One Well: The Story of Water on Earth. Students will examine maps and graphs to determine where the water is in the world and how much of our water comes from oceans, rivers, etc. They also will read other informational texts that require them to use graphics and diagrams. Throughout the unit, students will collect \u201cwater words\u201d (domain-specific vocabulary) and \u201cpower words\u201d (academic vocabulary). In the mid-unit assessment, students will write an on-demand informational paragraph about where water is on earth.\u00a0(This paragraph will help scaffold students for their final performance task in which they will create a public service announcement educating their audience about why water is important.) In the second half of the unit, students will compare and contrast different texts on rivers and the water cycle, including examining how graphics and illustrations convey meaning about the water cycle. Students will read texts of greater complexity and will practice coding text for the main idea and key details in order to compare and contrast them. For the end of unit assessment, students will apply their comparison skills by reading a new text about the water cycle and comparing how the information is portrayed in this text and in One Well: The Story of Water on Earth.",

              "description": "For this unit, students will build their knowledge of the challenges of access, pollution, and demands on water. Students first will research each challenge as a class, finding the key information about the particular challenge as they read their central text, One Well: The Story of Water on Earth. Students will answer text-dependent questions throughout their reading to ensure that they are able to use specific details and information from the text. The first half of this Unit, in effect, serves as a guided practice for research and builds students\u2019 knowledge about each challenge before they study one more in-depth. Students will continue to build their vocabulary with a focus on learning words from context. In the mid-unit assessment, students will demonstrate their ability to ask and answer questions based on an informational text in preparation for their research project in the second half of the unit. For the second half of the unit, students will work with\u00a0greater independence to conduct a short research project to research in more depth about one of the challenges regarding water: access, pollution, and demands on water. Students will take notes as they read, determining the most important details about this particular challenge. Students will work in partnerships, or with \u201cresearch buddies.\u201d Although they will read independently, they will have this peer to support them through the process. For the end of unit assessment, students will write a two-paragraph, on-demand informational piece about the challenges of water: One paragraph that synthesizes all three of the challenges regarding water and a second paragraph that goes into more detail to inform the reader about the specific challenge the student researched. This on-demand writing also will serve as a scaffold for their students\u2019 public service announcement (PSA), the final performance task that students will complete in Unit 3.",

Students develop an opinion about the \u201cone thing\u201d that should be done to ensure that everyone has access to clean water. In the first half of the unit, students read informational texts that focus on what people are doing to solve these water challenges. They also receive a Performance Task Invitation and listen to a model VoiceThread recording. Students engage in a discussion group to begin formulating their opinion about the one thing that should be done to ensure that everyone has clean water.Students use the information they have gathered from texts to develop their opinion. In the mid-unit assessment, students write an on-demand opinion paragraph about the one thing that should be done. Students then listen to a model VoiceThread multiple times to engage with, and fully understand, the final Performance Assessment Rubric. Students use the writing they did in Units 1 and 2 to develop the script for their VoiceThread recording of a public service announcement (PSA). For the end of unit assessment, students present their VoiceThread script to their peers. Through a process of critique, students give and receive peer feedback in order to make improvements to their final performance task PSA.

          "description": "Grade 4 ELA Module 1A Updates: September 2014 Module 1A focuses on building community by making connections between visual imagery, oral accounts, poetry and written texts of various cultures with a focus on the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) culture. Students will determine a central idea and demonstrate how gathering information from a variety of sources can help us understand a central idea more fully.\u00a0 Module 1 also reinforces reading fluency, close text analysis, explanatory paragraph writing, and presenting to peers. The module reinforces the fact that Native Americans\u2014specifically the Iroquois (Haudenosaunee, People of the Longhouse) \u2014were early inhabitants of the New York region and state, and continue to contribute to the region\u2019s history. \u00a0In Unit 1, students will read and listen closely to interpret main ideas and thematic connections between visual imagery (symbols and graphics), oral tradition (Haudenosaunee video) and literary texts (The Great Peacemaker, Two Row Wampum, and Frost\u2019s \u201cA Time to Talk\u201d).\u00a0 Students will demonstrate their understanding by creating symbols and writing explanatory paragraphs about how they connect to the texts (W.4.11, RL.4.11). Unit 3 expands on the conversation around symbolism and culture begun in Unit 1 to incorporate global perspectives. Students listen to, view, and close read informational texts regarding the traditions other cultures use to tell stories and pass down information. Students will review oral tradition and revisit it from a different angle as they explore the Griot tradition in Africa.\u00a0 Students will look at how symbols can be captured in art through blanket making in Hawaii and quilt making through Patricia Polacco\u2019s story The Keeping Quilt. Students will revisit specific texts and notes from Units 1 and 2 to examine how the central idea of community connects the texts within the module. Students will use these texts, videos, and their understanding of symbols, community, and cultural traditions to create a \u201cquilt\u201d that defines the classroom community. Each student will create a symbol on a quilt square that represents something they value about themselves and that they bring to the classroom community, such as a positive personality trait or accomplishment. Emulating the practice of oral tradition, students will then explain the symbolism behind their quilt squares, which will be the source of the end-of-unit assessment in which students will write to explain how the student-created quilt will unite the classroom as a community.",

This is followed by a \tgallery walk of symbols and a close read of \u201cBirth of the Haudenosaunee\u201d and \tseveral other texts to learn more about where the identity of the Haudenosaunee \tpeople comes from and who they are today.

The midunit\u00a0ondemand\u00a0assessment gauges students\u2019 ability to\u00a0analyze a new section of text about the Iroquois on their own. At the end of Unit 2,\u00a0students draw evidence from the informational text to describe how the lives of the\u00a0Haudenosaunee have changed and remained the same over time. (W.4.9) This unit includes an optional independent reading project using the literary text\u00a0Eagle Song by Joseph Bruchac (680L). The reading will focus on character\u00a0development and the experiences of a contemporary Mohawk boy living in New\u00a0York City. Lesson plans and writing activities are included in\u00a0the packet. This packet\u00a0will be available Summer 2014. Each chapter for Eagle Song contains an\u00a0accompanying lesson and each chapter is addressed in the Tracking my\u00a0Thinking Independent Reading Packet. It is important to note for planning\u00a0purposes that the lesson times for Eagle Song vary\u00a0considerably\u037e some lessons are\u00a0full 60 minute lessons, and some are 15. There is an optional assessment as well.",

              "description": "Unit 3 expands on the conversation around symbolism and culture begun in Unit 1 to incorporate global perspectives. Students listen to, view, and close read informational texts regarding the traditions other cultures use to tell stories and pass down information. Students will review oral tradition and revisit it from a different angle as they explore the Griot tradition in Africa. Students will look at how symbols can be captured in art through blanket making in Hawaii and quilt making through Patricia Polacco\u2019s story The Keeping Quilt. Students will revisit specific texts and notes from Units 1 and 2 to examine how the central idea of community connects the texts within the module. Students will use these texts, videos, and their understanding of symbols, community, and cultural traditions to create a \u201cquilt\u201d that defines the classroom community. Each student will create a symbol on a quilt square that represents something they value about themselves and that they bring to the classroom community, such as a positive personality trait or accomplishment. Emulating the practice of oral tradition, students will then explain the symbolism behind their quilt squares, which will be the source of the end-of-unit assessment in which students will write to explain how the student-created quilt will unite the classroom as a community.",

          "description": "In this eight-week module, students will learn about poetry and poets through close reading and writing to learn. Throughout the module, they will determine the characteristics of poetry and consider what inspires writers and poets. Students begin in Unit 1 by reading the first half of the novel Love That Dog by Sharon Creech. Students follow the main character, Jack, as he learns about poetry and begins to write his own. Students closely read and analyze poems Jack reads, including \u201cThe Red Wheelbarrow\u201d by William Carlos Williams and \u201cStopping by Woods on a Snowing Evening\u201d by Robert Frost. Throughout this unit, students track what Jack is learning about poetry alongside their own learning though these close readings. They also experiment with writing their own poetry inspired by their reading. Students practice summarizing the events in the novel and discuss how the main character\u2019s attitude toward poetry begins to change in this half of the novel. In Unit 2, students engage in deeper analysis of Jack\u2019s character and his inspiration through extended discussion prompts. They also learn to write informational paragraphs in order to summarize larger portions of the text. For the mid-unit 2 assessment, they write a summary of the entire novel. After completing the novel, students consider which of the poems they read inspired them the most and select a poet to study more deeply. In the last half of Unit 2, students read and analyze poems by their selected poet and engage in a poetry workshop to write an original poem inspired by their selected poet. Finally, in Unit 3, students prepare for their three-part performance task, a Poet\u2019s Performance, in which students read aloud a poem by their selected poet, share an essay about the poet, and read their original inspired poem. In this unit, students are introduced to biography though reading River of Words: The Story of William Carlos Williams. They then closely read a biography about their own poet. Then students learn to write an essay about their selected poet through engaging in a shared writing of an essay about William Carlos Williams. As the class writes each part of this shared essay (introduction, body, and conclusion), students complete their own essays one section at a time. Throughout this unit, students practice reading their poems aloud clearly and with expression. Once students\u2019 essays are complete, they finish the module by presenting their poems and essay during the performance task.",

              "description": "Unit 1: Reading to Learn about Poetry In this unit, students read the first half of the novel Love That Dog by Sharon\u00a0Creech, as well as poems by authors such as William Carlos Williams, Robert Frost,\u00a0and Valerie Worth, to help them begin to answer one of the guiding questions:\u00a0\u201cWhat makes a poem a poem?\u201d Students follow the main character, Jack, as he\u00a0learns about and begins to experiment with writing his own poetry. Students read\u00a0each poem that Jack reads, along with Jack\u2019s personal reflections on the poems.\u00a0They work in small groups to capture notes that help them describe how Jack\u2019s\u00a0understanding of poetry develops over time as well as characteristics of poetry\u00a0related to structure and word choice. Students apply what they learn through\u00a0writing routines that encourage them to experiment with the poetic elements they\u00a0learn about. Vocabulary work throughout this unit focuses on building students\u2019\u00a0ability to determine the meaning of key terms from the context and explaining the\u00a0meaning of simple metaphors and similes. For the mid-unit assessment, students independently read then respond to text-dependent\u00a0questions about pages 20\u201324 of Love That Dog and the poem \u201cThe\u00a0Pasture\u201d by Robert Frost, to demonstrate their ability to explain what the text says\u00a0explicitly by referring to details from the text, describe Jack\u2019s thoughts about\u00a0poetry, and determine the meaning of key terms from the context. For the end of\u00a0unit assessment, students independently read pages 39\u201341 of Love That Dog to\u00a0determine the meaning of key terms through the use of a variety of strategies as\u00a0well as plan and write a response to the question: What has Jack learned about\u00a0poetry?",

              "description": "Unit 2: Writing to Learn about Poetry In this unit, students apply what they have learned in Unit 1 to further explore\u00a0poetry through writing. Students begin the unit with a shared writing experience,\u00a0writing a summary of the first half of the novel Love That Dog by Sharon Creech.\u00a0Then, they complete their reading of the book with a focus on what inspired Jack as\u00a0a writer. Students are guided in finding and organizing evidence for this prompt in\u00a0preparation for a book discussion with peers. For the mid-unit assessment,\u00a0students write a summary of the full novel (RL.4.2, W.4.9, W.4.2.a, b). In the second half of the unit, students are introduced to the performance task\u00a0(which has three parts; see stand-alone document). They continue to focus on\u00a0learning about poetry through writing, now by writing their own poems. Students\u00a0choose from a selected group of poets to study more deeply, and in small \u201cpoet\u00a0groups\u201d will read and analyze new poems by these poets. Then, students will write\u00a0an inspired poem as one part of the performance task. Students will then be\u00a0introduced to the peer critique process and use what they have learned about poetry\u00a0to revise their original poems with a focus on imagery. The unit ends with students\u00a0reading and analyzing a new poem for the end of unit assessment (RL.4.5, L.4.5a).",

              "description": "Unit 3: Researching a Selected Poet and Writing a Biographical Essay In this unit, students are introduced to biographies with the text A River of Words:\u00a0The Story of William Carlos Williams, by Jen Bryant. Students read this narrative\u00a0nonfiction text closely to build understanding about how William Carlos Williams\u00a0became inspired to write poetry. Students then closely read portions of the text to\u00a0gather additional information about Williams\u2019 life. Next, students closely read\u00a0biographies about the poet they selected to study for part of the performance task.\u00a0Students are also introduced to biographical timelines and use these as an\u00a0additional source of information about their poet\u2019s life. For the mid-unit\u00a0assessment, students will read a biography of another poet, answering text-dependent\u00a0questions to demonstrate their progress toward standards RI.4.1,\u00a0RI.4.2, and RI.4.3. In the second half of this unit, students prepare for the performance task for this\u00a0module, the Poet\u2019s Performance. In this three-part performance task, students focus\u00a0on a single poet, presenting a poem by that poet, writing a short essay about the\u00a0poet, and reading aloud an original poem inspired by their poet. The class learns to\u00a0write an essay by planning and writing a shared essay about poet William Carlos\u00a0Williams. Then students plan for their essays using notes gathered from the first\u00a0half of the unit, and complete a draft of the essay for the first part of the end of unit\u00a0assessment (RI.4.9 and W.4.2). Next, students engage in a round of critique and\u00a0feedback to improve their work and complete a revised draft for the second part of\u00a0the end of unit assessment (W.4.5). Finally, students read aloud their poems and\u00a0essay for the Poet\u2019s Performance.",

With an emphasis on making inferences, summarizing informational text, basic research (note-taking and pulling together information from a variety of texts), this module will foster students\u2019 abilities to synthesize information from multiple sources and integrate research into their writing.

They will gain a deeper understanding of how colonists depended on each other for survival, and begin to explore gender roles in colonies and colonial households. Students will learn to support their inferences with examples and details from complex informational text. They will practice synthesizing information from multiple sources (including text, pictures, maps, diagrams, and charts).",

INFERRED INFORMATION Focus on the difference between explicit and inferred information and how the two support one another. Readers need explicit information in order to infer; they then can use additional explicit information to confirm what they infer. The purpose of this lesson is to help students learn how to keep going back to the text, and to think about how the words and images go together. It is important that students do not over rely on images when they make an inference. In this lesson students work in the same groups they did when examining the mystery documents in Lesson 1. Remember those groups, or form new groups of four or five.",

To build students\u2019 background knowledge, the class will work together to study the wheelwright, a colonial trade. They will then work in research Expert Groups as they become experts in one specific colonial trade. Students will select from: shoemaker, cooper, blacksmith, builder/carpenter, or printer. Students will study a variety of informational texts and also will learn the importance of citing sources by keeping a list of the key sources they used during their research. With an emphasis on making inferences, summarizing informational text, and basic research (note-taking, pulling together information from a variety of texts, and sorting information into research categories), students synthesize information from multiple sources.

The main point of Lesson 5 is for students to get the gist of the text well enough to be able to generate categories for their future note taking and research. This lesson\u2019s Work Time Part B is particularly important, because the categories students come up with are the ones they will use to guide their own research later in the unit. The body of the lesson includes suggestions for likely categories. Be sure that students come up with the categories. The fourth- grade standard for note-taking (W.4.8) states explicitly that students need to be able to \u201ccategorize information\u201d (as compared to the third-grade standard, which says students need to be able to \u201csort\u201d information into \u201cprovided categories\u201d).",

Students synthesize information from varied sources they used as they researched Colonial America in Units 1 and 2 to create a historically accurate research-based narrative from a prompt (see Performance Task). They begin the unit by creating a character profile of a tradesman who might have lived during Colonial America. They then work as a class to write a practice narrative about the wheelwright. The latter part of the unit involves students writing multiple drafts, focusing on historically accurate information, a strong narrative arc, and effective use of dialogue. Students refer to their vocabulary notebook for a bank of words they gathered during Units 1 and 2. As they draft and revise, students work with the teacher to co-construct a rubric on which their work will be evaluated. They also participate in several structured peer critiques as they work toward a final polished narrative. (As an optional extension, the class could then compile the final draft narratives into a single class publication that documents life in colonial times and how the people relied on each other for survival.)",

Mentor texts are model texts written by real authors that students examine in order to see strong examples of writing craft.\u00a0In this unit, students analyze various examples of historical fiction. For more information on the use of mentor texts, read Study Driven by Katie Wood Ray.",

          "description": "In this eight-week module, students explore animal defense mechanisms. They build proficiency in writing an informative piece, examining the defense mechanisms of one specific animal about which they build expertise. Students also build proficiency in writing a narrative piece about this animal. In Unit 1, students build background knowledge on general animal defenses through close readings of several informational texts. Students will read closely to practice drawing inferences as they begin their research and use a science journal to make observations and synthesize information. Students will continue to use the science journal, using the millipede as a whole class model. They begin to research an expert animal in preparation to write about this animal in Units 2 and 3, again using the science journal. In Unit 2, students will continue to build expertise about their animal and its defense mechanisms, writing the first part of the final performance task\u2014an informative piece describing their animal, the threats to its survival, and how it is equipped to deal with them. With their new knowledge about animal defenses from Unit 1, students will read informational texts closely, using the same science journal to synthesize information about their animal. Unit 3 allows students to apply their research from Units 1 and 2 to write a narrative piece about their animal that incorporates their research. This narrative will take the format of a choose-your-own-adventure. For their performance task, students will plan, draft, and revise the introduction and one choice ending of the narrative with the support of both peer and teacher feedback.

Students start by sorting these \u201cMystery Pictures\u201d into inferred categories, then read an informational text from the book Simple Machines to learn basic information about simple machines. Once students discover the topic, they build background knowledge by rereading the text from Simple Machines and determine the main idea and supporting details, as well as the main points related to the scientific concepts of force, effort, and work explained in the text. This is followed by a mid-unit assessment of RI4.2 and RI4.3. Students then read and analyze Readers Theater The Machine, which engages students as they continue to build content knowledge about simple machines, and also introduces students to a new genre (drama). They will examine the structure of drama and learn how drama is different from other types of literature (RL.4.5). The end of unit assessment focuses on standards RL.4.5 and RL4.1: Students read a new Readers Theater about simple machines and answer questions about the characteristics of this type of drama as well as information about simple machines contained within the text. Overall, this unit prepares students for their deeper study in Unit 2 about simple machines and the work they do to help people.",

Several sections of this science text are structured as close-reading experiences, and students continue to learn to use context clues to determine the meaning of new words. They write routinely in order to explain how various simple machines work. Students also experience the scientific method in several simple experiments. They develop hypotheses, document steps in experiments, and synthesize their learning about how simple machines work in scientific conclusions. In the mid-unit assessment, students are asked to read an on-demand text about a simple machine, the screw, and answer text-dependent and multiple-choice questions. The end of unit assessment also has the students read a scientific text about a simple machine, the wedge, and answer text-dependent and multiple-choice questions. In addition, the students read an experiment, answer text-dependent questions, and conduct the experiment. They are asked to explain in writing their observations and conclude about wedges and their impact on work from the experiment.",

Students will read and analyze two editorials as mentor texts in order to study author\u2019s craft, specifically how to identify opinions in writing and how authors use reasons with evidence to support their opinions. Students will then plan for their editorials by revisiting their\u00a0notes in their Simple Machine science journals and the central text Simple Machines: Forces in Action by Buffy Silverman to develop reasons for their opinions and gather evidence to support these reasons. Students will then draft their editorials and revise their work based on a series of lessons in which students examine the characteristics of opinion writing.",

          "description": "In this module, students will read, write, and speak about the topic of voting rights and responsibilities. In the first two units, students will read informational texts that focus on the women\u2019s suffrage movement and the leadership of New Yorker Susan B. Anthony. Specifically, they will read firsthand and secondhand accounts of her arrest and trial for voting in a time when women were outlawed from doing so. Students then read The Hope Chest by Karen Schwabach, a historical fiction novel set in the weeks leading up to the passage of the 19th Amendment. They will continue to examine the idea of leaders of change and explore the theme \u201cmaking a difference\u201d by collecting evidence on how selected characters make a difference for others. After completing the novel, students will analyze this theme in selected passages of the novel and write an essay using evidence from the text to support their analysis. In the final unit, students will connect the ideas of \u201cleaders of change\u201d and \u201cmaking a difference\u201d to their own lives by reading about the importance of voting. They will prepare for their performance task, a Public Service Announcement about the importance of voting. To prepare, they will read various informational texts on contemporary voting to build background knowledge and collect evidence for their scripts. They will then write a draft of their script and practice speaking before recording and presenting their Public Service Announcement to peers, their parents, or local high school seniors. This performance task centers on NYSP12 ELA Standards RI.4.9, W.4.1, W.4.4, SL.4.3, SL.4.4, SL.4.5, SL.4.6, L.4.1c and f, and L.4.3. Note: The audio file titled\u00a0Helmet Public Service Announcement is contained within the Zip file of Word documents and it is located in the unit 3 folder. The mp3 file is also available for download below.",

Students will read a variety of informational texts as well as primary source documents. In Lessons 1 and 2, students are introduced to the topic through examining a timeline on the history of voting in America and an excerpt of a speech by Susan B. Anthony. (They will revisit the speech throughout the module.) Throughout the first half of this unit, students will read and summarize several informational texts about Susan B. Anthony. Students will also learn to use glossaries, context clues, and\u00a0deconstructing parts of words as strategies for understanding unfamiliar academic and domain-specific words. This is followed by a mid-unit assessment of RI.4.2 and RI.4.4. Students then continue learning about Susan B. Anthony\u2019s role in the suffrage movement, comparing firsthand and secondhand accounts of key events in the history of voting in America. The end of unit assessment focuses on RI.4.2 and RI.4.6: Students compare firsthand and secondhand accounts of a modern-era historical event (the inauguration of Barack Obama).",

This novel is a piece of historical fiction set in 1920 during the passage of the 19th Amendment, which gave women in the United States the right to vote. This unit builds off the background knowledge students built in Unit 1 about Susan B. Anthony and the beginning of the suffrage movement. In reading this novel, students will continue to explore this topic and the theme \u201cmaking a difference\u201d through an analysis of the characters and events in the novel. Students will work on summarizing and analysis of characters in the first half of the unit, and analysis of a central theme in the\u00a0second half of the unit. They will use a series of chapter-by-chapter reading guides that include historical background information, a glossary of both domain-specific and academic vocabulary, and lists of complex figurative language (idioms and adages) related to this historical time period. Throughout the unit, students will demonstrate their ability to analyze the novel and its characters through writing a series of scaffolded and on-demand essays, ending with an on-demand essay that requires them to analyze how a particular character contributes to the central theme of the novel, \u201cmaking a difference.\u201d",

              "description": "In this unit, students will be introduced to their performance task for this module, a Public Service Announcement (PSA) about the importance of voting. This unit connects students\u2019 study of the Women\u2019s Suffrage Movement in Units 1 and 2 to voting in the present day, specifically the issue of low voter turnout among young adults.\u00a0 Students will take their own steps towards being a \u201cleader of change\u201d and \u201cmaking a difference\u201d by creating a PSA with the purpose of educating young people about the importance of voting. To prepare for this task, students listen to and read the transcript of a model PSA, in order to identify the purpose and criteria of their task. They also read two articles about youth voting and identify a variety of reasons why voting is important and use these texts to gather evidence to support these identified reasons. Then, students select two reasons to feature in the PSAs and begin to craft their scripts. After practicing the presentation of their PSAs and receiving feedback from their peers, they present their finalized PSAs to an audience.",

Students will develop their ability to read and understand complex text as they consider this question. Students will begin to build knowledge about human rights through a close read of the introduction and selected articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), paired with short firsthand accounts of people around the world who currently face human rights challenges. In Unit 2, students will do an extended study of Esperanza Rising (740L) by Pam Mu\u00f1oz Ryan, applying their new learning about human rights as one lens through which to interpret the character and theme in this rich novel\u2014a complex coming-of-age story set in Mexico and rural California during the early 1930s. Through close reading, interpretation, and analysis of fiction and nonfiction texts, students will synthesize their understanding of human rights. The specific literacy focus is on supporting understanding through quoting directly from text, inferring theme, and comparing and contrasting how different texts address the topics and themes of human rights. Students will write an analytical essay in which they describe how a character in the novel responds to challenges. In Unit 3, students will continue to revisit the text and themes of the UDHR and Esperanza Rising as they read, write, and ultimately perform Readers Theater. Students will compare novels and Readers Theater as two forms of narrative writing. They will then select specific articles of the UDHR that relate thematically to the novel and reread key passages of the novel with that theme in mind. They will write individual and small group scripts based on these key passages and on phrases from the UDHR. Students will revise, rehearse, and ultimately perform their group Readers Theater scripts for their class and/or school or community members. This performance task centers on NYSP12 standards W.5.3, W.5.4, W.5.5, and W.5.11.",

This unit is designed to help students build knowledge about these questions while simultaneously building their ability to read challenging text closely. Students begin this unit by exploring human rights themes through images and key vocabulary. They then will analyze selected Articles from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) through a series of close readings text-dependent tasks and questions, discussions, and writing. They will explore the history of the development and language of universal human rights documents, developing skills to determine meaning of words and phrases and learn to quote from an informational text to explain meaning that supports inferences. The Mid-Unit 1 Assessment will be an on-demand quiz of content and academic vocabulary from the UDHR. Students then will examine firsthand accounts of people\u2019s experiences with human rights. This unit culminates with a short piece of on demand writing, in which they analyze the firsthand accounts and explain how an individual\u2019s or group\u2019s rights were either challenged or upheld.

This unit emphasizes the Reading Literature strand of the NYSP12 CCLS, with a study of the novel Esperanza Rising by Pam Mu\u00f1oz Ryan (740L). Students also read informational texts related to the story\u2019s historical context. They will trace the journey of Esperanza, a young girl born into a comfortable life of privilege in Mexico in the 1930s who is forced to flee to California and must rise above her difficult circumstances. This unit is designed to deliberately build students\u2019 ability to write routinely to learn. Almost daily, they will write short informational pieces in their reading journals, in which they record their interpretations of concrete details and quotations from the book. They will analyze characters\u2019 responses to challenges and will analyze how Esperanza changes over time. For the mid-unit assessment, students will independently read and analyze a new chapter in the novel, focusing on the challenges Esperanza faces, how she responds, and what that tells readers about her as a character. In the second half of the unit, students compare and contrast Esperanza to other characters in the novel, focusing specifically on how various characters respond to the challenges in their work camp and whether or not the migrant workers should strike. Students will create a two-voice poem contrasting the ways two different characters respond to a similar challenge. They will then write a formal essay in which they analyze how Esperanza changes throughout the novel.",

This is intentional; by this point in the study, students should be becoming increasingly independent. These chapters are also formally revisited in Lesson 15, before students begin their formal analytical essay about how Esperanza has grown and changed. Lessons 13 and 14 engage students in working with a partner or their triad to write a Two-Voice Poem, in which they compare and contrast Esperanza to one of the other main characters in the novel. Note that this poem is an assignment, NOT a formal assessment. Students are not given time in these two lessons to create a final polished piece. Rather, the purpose is for students to continue working with reviewing textual evidence and planning writing in an engaging, creative way (more interesting, for example, than a Venn diagram). This planning serves as a scaffold to students\u2019 more formal writing in Lessons 16-18.",

This unit emphasizes the Reading Literature and Writing Narratives strands of the NYSP12 ELA CCLS. Students analyze and selecting passages of Esperanza Rising connected to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights for the purpose of developing and performing their own Readers Theater scripts. In the first half of the unit, students will learn about Readers Theater by reading informational texts and also examining a variety of Readers Theater scripts. They will reread sections of the novel and study and perform a Readers Theater script written by the novel\u2019s author. For the mid-unit assessment students will evaluate the strengths and limitations of novels and theater scripts in terms of how well each genre engages its audience. In the second half of this unit, students collaborate to write their own Readers Theater script. They will work in small groups to select passages (from multiple chapters) of Esperanza Rising that reflect characters\u2019 experiences with human rights challenges. After learning writing techniques such as dialogue, each student will write a section of a script based on the passage the group selected. This script section will serve as the on-demand end of unit assessment; students also will write a justification to explain how the passage their group selected relates to a specific article from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Then students will work in their small group to combine their script sections, with a focus on clear transitions. Students will then revise and practice their scripts for a final performance task, in which they perform their Readers Theater scripts for peers. (As an optional extension, students also could perform for their school and community.)",

This lesson gives students an opportunity to review and consolidate that knowledge. This lesson involves students physically working with evidence, which students also did in Unit 1, Lesson 10 (when they sorted evidence from a firsthand human rights account). Review that lesson. In the closing of this lesson, students write a brief exit ticket stating their preferences for their Readers Theater focus and group members.

This beautifully illustrated informational text describes the work of scientists documenting the biodiversity of rainforests. The specific literacy focus is on reading scientific and technical text as well as writing to inform and explain. In the first unit, students build basic background knowledge about the rainforest (particularly those of the Western Hemisphere), and begin to examine how scientists closely observe the natural world to then help them communicate their research through carefully organized and worded scientific text. Unit 2 focuses on a case study of Meg Lowman, the researcher featured in The Most Beautiful Roof in the World. Students then analyze the structure and function of scientific field guides and filed journals determining what quality field guides and journals look and sound like. Students research about a living thing that scientist Meg Lowman may encounter in the rainforest in her research and write with clear and effective word choice about their chosen insect of the rainforest. As the final performance task, students produce an informational report and then field journal\u2013style pages intended for younger readers. This performance task centers on NYSP12 ELA CCSS RI.5.7, RI.5.9, W.5.2, W.5.3, W.5.4, W.5.7, W.5.8, and W.5.9.",

Students will also explore various forms of informational text as ways to communicate about rainforest scientists\u2019 research. Students examine two types of informational texts, an interview and an article, for specific elements and how those elements inform the reader. During those close reads, students will also build their background knowledge about rainforests of the Western Hemisphere through a focus on vocabulary and finding the main idea. The mid-unit assessment will gauge students\u2019 mastery of comprehending an interview as an informational text by answering text-dependent questions for a given new and unfamiliar interview of a scientist doing work in the rainforest. Students will continue to gain knowledge about living things in the rainforest and apply the skills learned to explore one more type of informational text, a video, in order to continue to develop an understanding of the biodiversity of the rainforest. Through further close reads, an introduction to notetaking, synthesis, and comparisons of these informational texts, students will begin to formulate an opinion on what types of informational texts, based on their specific features, made it easiest for them to learn about rainforests and why. Finally, the on-demand end of unit assessment will measure students\u2019 ability to comprehend an unfamiliar informational text on rainforest biodiversity as well as write an opinion paragraph that states which text they consider most helpful based on its features and why.",

Knight. They will take an in-depth view of how one scientist, Meg Lowman, became interested in her chosen career, created new ways to study the natural world, and communicates her findings to others. Students will compare and contrast Meg Lowman\u2019s work to other rainforest scientists while navigating the terrain of various forms of informational text (articles, interviews, videos). The class also will read the short story \u201cThe Wings of a Butterfly,\u201d fiction modeled after an indigenous tribe\u2019s folktale of animal encounters with humans in the Amazon rainforest. This will allow the students further opportunity to practice fluency when reading as well as compare literature to informational text. For the mid-unit assessment, students will demonstrate skills learned for determining the meaning of new vocabulary and the main ideas in informational text through the completion of a textdependent short- answer quiz. In the end of unit assessment students will continue to demonstrate their ability to summarize, use quotes to explain the meaning of text, and determine the meaning of new words in context. In preparation for individual research to be conducted in Unit 3, the members of the class will hone in specifically on the research Meg Lowman did during extended stays in the canopy of the rainforest. Students will write an essay in which they analyze Lowman\u2019s research of biodiversity in the rainforests, providing examples of what and how she researches in order to clarify their analysis.",

First, students will learn how to write field notes like a scientist, by observing carefully and writing precisely about their local natural environment. Then they will work within expert groups to conduct research on the insects found in the rainforest, taking notes from print and digital sources. The mid-unit assessment will gauge students\u2019 mastery of note-taking skills: They will read and take notes on passages of unfamiliar informational text on a different rainforest species\u2014the howler monkey. Students will then return to their focus on insects and will write narratives in the form of rainforest explorer\u2019s field journal entries that incorporate their research notes on insects. This will be the unit\u2019s final performance task. For the on-demand end of unit assessment, students will use the notes they took during the mid-unit assessment to create an additional field journal page on the howler monkey. (As an extension, students also may create a field guide to the local environment, drawing on their observations from nature and making parallels to the information they have gathered about the rainforest.)",

          "description": "Researching to Build Knowledge and Teaching Others:\u00a0Inventions That Changed People\u2019s Lives In this eight-week module, students learn about new or improved technologies that have been developed to meet societal needs and how those inventions have changed people\u2019s lives. They conduct authentic research to build their own knowledge and teach others through writing. In Unit 1, students read the graphic novel Investigating the Scientific Method with Max Axiom, Super Scientist by Donald B. Lemke as well as several informational articles about inventions that have been developed to meet people\u2019s needs. Students learn about and analyze structures and visual elements authors use to convey complex ideas. Then, they will write a short opinion paragraph about which of the inventions they learned about has been most important to people and why. In Unit 2, students will read The Boy Who Invented TV: The Story of Philo Farnsworth by Kathleen Krull, focusing on how the television was invented to meet societal needs. Students will write an informative essay to explain why Philo Farnsworth wanted to invent television and how TV changed people\u2019s lives. In Unit 3, students are given the choice to conduct research about one of two inventions that were developed to meet societal needs, Garrett A. Morgan\u2019s traffic light or the Wright brothers\u2019 airplane. Students will closely read and collect information about one of these inventions in order to develop a narrative in the form of a graphic novelette that explains why the invention they researched was developed and how it changed people\u2019s lives. This task addresses NYSP12 ELA CCLS R.I.5.9,W.5.2, W.5.3, W.5.4, W.5.5,W.5.6,W.5.7, W.5.8, L.5.3, and L.5.4.",

          "description": "This module begins with a brief study of the importance of sports in American culture over time. The heart of this module is a whole class study of the short but challenging biography Promises to Keep: How Jackie Robinson Changed America (1030L) by his daughter, Sharon Robinson. (Students will read selected segments; some of these will be read aloud.) Students will analyze Jackie Robinson as a specific example of an athlete who served as a leader who broke barriers in society. They will also begin to study argumentative writing, analyzing how the author Sharon Robinson provides evidence to support her opinions. In Unit 3, students then choose to learn about one of three other respected sports figures (Roberto Clemente, Babe Didrikson, or Jim Thorpe). Students will develop their understanding of the cultural context in which these athletes competed and the barriers these athletes broke during the times in which they lived. Students will build their research skills by reading biographical articles and other informational texts and by participating in Webquests. They also will continue to build their skills to write arguments based on multiple sources, focusing on crafting clear opinions and providing sufficient reasons and evidence. For the final performance task, each student will write a letter to a publishing company explaining the need for a biography about their selected athlete, in which they discuss the athlete, evaluate the barriers that he/she broke during the era in which he/she lived, and give an opinion about the importance of that athlete\u2019s impact on American society. They must support their opinions with evidence from their research. This task centers on NYSP12 ELA CCLS RI.5.9, W.5.1,W.5.4, W.5.5, W.5.7, W.5.8, W.5.9, L.5.1, L.5.2, and L.5.6.",

They will read two informational articles: \u201cIt\u2019s Not Just a Game!\u201d and \u201cThe Literature of Baseball: The Quintessential American Game.\u201d Students will also be reintroduced to reading and writing arguments (RI.5.8 and W.5.1). They will begin to explore how to read opinion pieces. They will be introduced to the term \u201copinion\u201d and be asked to identify and explain how authors use evidence to support their opinions. For the mid-unit assessment, students will read and answer text-dependent questions\u00a0about a new informational article, \u201cRoots of American Sports,\u201d which will help further build students\u2019 knowledge about the importance of sports in American society. For the end of unit on-demand assessment, students begin to practice citing evidence to support an opinion, specifically: \u201cSports are an important part of American Culture.\u201d Then they will identify supporting evidence for the opinion, organize their ideas, and write an opinion paragraph using the opinion and supporting details they identified.",

As the author (Jackie Robinson\u2019s daughter) states in the book\u2019s introduction, this photographic biography is about \u201ca man who was shaped by American history and who had an impact on American history.\u201d While reading the book, students will focus on the craft of writing opinion pieces, and specifically, how writers use\u00a0evidence and logically ordered reasons to support their points of view. The mid-unit assessment will gauge students\u2019 proficiency at explaining how authors support their opinions with reasons and evidence. Their reading and analysis will prepare students for writing their own opinion piece, an essay about Jackie Robinson\u2019s legacy. The end of unit assessment will test students on their ability to state a opinion and support that opinion with strong evidence from the text.",

              "description": "In this unit, students choose to research about either Roberto Clemente or Althea Gibson: two respected American sports figures. Students will develop their understanding of the cultural context in which these athletes competed and the barriers these athletes broke during the times in which they lived. Students will build their research skills by reading biographical articles and other informational texts. They will read, reread, and synthesize, taking notes and choosing one of two different organizational structures (chronological or order of importance) with which to organize their ideas. For their mid-unit assessment, they will synthesize their notes in a graphic organizer, which they will return to later in the unit when writing their letter to a publisher (the Performance Task). During the second half of the unit, students will step back from their own research to participate in some \u201cshared writing.\u201d With teacher support, the class will write and revise a model letter to a publishing company as if they were Sharon Robinson, explaining the need for a biography to be written for elementary students about her father, Jackie\u00a0Robinson, and his legacy. (They will draw from their opinion essays from their End of Unit 2 Assessment.) This shared writing experience will help students continue to build their skills to write arguments based on multiple sources, focusing on crafting clear opinions and providing sufficient reasons and evidence. After this guided practice experience, students will return to writing about the athlete they researched. For their end of unit assessment, students will write their best independent draft of their letter to a publishing company, explaining the need for a biography about their chosen athlete, in which they discuss the athlete, evaluate the barriers that he/she broke during the era in which he/she lived, and his or her impact on American society through her or his legacy. They must support their opinion with evidence from their research. They then participate in critique and feedback from peers and the teacher in order to improve on their draft. Students then read their letters out loud to the class. This written performance task centers on NYSP12 ELA Standards RI.5.9, W.5.1, W.5.4, W.5.5, W.5.7, W.5.8, L.5.1, L.5.2, and L.5.6.",

          "description": "Considering Perspectives and Supporting Opinions: Balancing Competing Needs in Canada In this module, students explore how native Inuit and other people of Canada have used the natural resources available to meet their needs. In Unit 1, students read The Inuit Thought of It: Amazing Arctic Innovations, by Alootook Ipellie with David MacDonald, to learn about how the native Inuit people of Canada used natural resources in the Arctic to adapt and meet the needs of their community hundreds of years ago. In Unit 2, students read and view a variety of informational texts and media, including graphs, charts, and maps, to examine how the resources available in Canada today are used to develop products that meet the needs and wants of people in Canada and throughout the Western Hemisphere. They will also explore ways that resource industries modify and/or affect the physical environment. In the third unit, students read a variety of informational texts to research, analyze, and reflect upon two points of view regarding a current mining project that has been proposed for development on Baffin Island, a present-day Inuit community in the territory of Nunavut. Students will express their opinion in the form of a four paragraph editorial essay. For the final performance task, students will share the final drafts of their editorials in small groups, using the Fishbowl protocol. This task addresses NYSP12 ELA CCLS W.5.1, W.5.4, W.5.5, W.5.8, W.5.9 b, L.5.1c, d, L.5.2a, b, d, e, SL.5.1, and SL.5.3.",

For the mid-unit assessment, students will read and answer text-dependent questions about one new informational text about hurricanes. Following the mid-unit\u00a0assessment, students will be read another new informational text, this one about earthquakes. They will then synthesize the information from both informational texts about hurricanes and earthquakes and organize their ideas in preparation for the end of unit assessment. For the end of unit on-demand assessment, students write an essay in which they explain how a hurricane is a natural disaster as well as participate in a Science Talk with peers about natural disasters. Students cite and organize evidence from multiple texts on the same topic.",

Throughout the unit they will discuss the guiding question: \u201cWhat can literature about natural disasters teach us about their impact on the people who experience them?\u201d Students will first read the picture book Eight Days: A Story of Haiti, and discuss text-dependent questions to infer about the impact of this disaster on the characters in the story. They will then collaborate to write a shared literary analysis essay that focuses on the narrator\u2019s point of view to infer about how this influences how events are described in the text. Students will then analyze imagery and figurative language in the text to determine how these elements contribute to the meaning of the story. Next, students will read a short story titled \u201cSave Bella!\u201d about the experience of a boy and his pet dog during Hurricane Katrina. With this text, too, they will continue to build their understanding of the impact of natural disasters on the lives of the people who survive them. Students will then more independently analyze the text and write a short essay on how a narrator\u2019s point of view influences the description of events before, during, and after the hurricane. For the mid-unit assessment, students will read a new piece of short fiction, \u201cIn the Middle of the Storm,\u201d about Hurricane Sandy, and demonstrate their ability to read, analyze, and write about a narrator\u2019s point of view and its influence on the description of events. Afterward, students will read about the perspectives of the authors who wrote the texts they have read and infer about how the background of an author affects his or her perspective on a natural disaster. They will also synthesize their thinking about the guiding question through written reflection and discussion. Finally, for the end of unit assessment, students will read about the perspective of another author and, as an optional arts integration, consider their own perspective on the impact of natural disasters on survivors through a piece of artwork.",

              "description": "In this unit, students use their reading skills to analyze informational texts, building their background knowledge about the earthquake that struck Haiti in 2010. Simultaneously, they learn about writing and delivering an effective speech through an analysis of the joint speech given by President Obama and former presidents Clinton and Bush in the days after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. As a connection to Social Studies, students also read primary source documents to conduct research about how the United States, through multinational organizations such as the Red Cross, responds to disasters in the Western Hemisphere. For the mid-unit assessment, students complete a short constructed response to explain the importance of providing aid to a country struck by a hypothetical hurricane, and then prioritize and organize their research notes into a graphic organizer to plan their opinion speech about how aid should be prioritized. Students then practice crafting the opinion speech through a brief shared writing experience. They\u00a0examine the Obama/Clinton/Bush speech as well as a TED Talk given by a student to co-construct a rubric that addresses the speaking and listening standards for delivering a speech to an audience. During the End of Unit 3 Assessment, students draft a speech for the final performance task about how to prioritize aid following a hypothetical hurricane in Mexico. They then participate in a critique, feedback, and revision session with peers. Next, students receive instruction on language conventions to focus on editing their speeches for punctuation, verb tense, correlative conjunctions, and sentences to enhance clarity or meaning. Students have time to practice their speeches; they then deliver their final speeches to group members. The performance task incorporates both the final draft of the written speech (NYSP12 ELA CCLS RI.5.7, RI.5.9, W.5.1, W.5.4, W.5.5, W.5.7, W.5.8, W.5.9, L.5.1, L.5.2, L.5.3, and L.5.6) and the public speaking task (NYSP12 ELA CCLS SL.5.4 and SL.5.6).",

          "description": "Myths: Not Just Long Ago In this module, students are involved in a deep study of mythology, its purposes, and elements. Students will read Rick Riordan\u2019s The Lightning Thief (780L), a high-interest novel about a sixth-grade boy on a hero\u2019s journey. Some students may be familiar with this popular fantasy book; in this module, students will read with a focus on the archetypal journey and close reading of the many mythical allusions. As they begin the novel, students also will read a complex informational text that explains the archetypal storyline of the hero\u2019s journey which has been repeated in literature throughout the centuries. Through the close reading of literary and informational texts, students will learn multiple strategies for acquiring and using academic vocabulary. Students will also build routines and expectations of discussion as they work in small groups. At the end of Unit 1, having read half of the novel, students will explain, with text-based evidence, how Percy is an archetypal hero. In Unit 2, students will continue reading The Lightning Thief (more independently): in class, they will focus on the novel\u2019s many allusions to classic myths; those allusions will serve as an entry point into a deeper study of Greek mythology. They also will continue to build their informational reading skills through the close reading of texts about the close reading of texts about the elements of myths. This will create a conceptual framework to support students\u2019 reading of mythology. As a whole class, students will closely read several complex Greek myths. They then will work in small groups to build expertise on one of those myths. In Unit 3, students shift their focus to narrative writing skills. This series of writing lessons will scaffold students to their final performance task in which they will apply their knowledge about the hero\u2019s journey and the elements of mythology to create their own hero\u2019s journey stories. This task centers on NYSP12 ELA Standards RL.6.3, W.6.3, W.6.4, W.6.5, W.6.6, L.6.2, and L.6.3.",

This unit is designed to build students\u2019 background understanding of the archetype of the hero\u2019s journey and its continuing significance in modern literature. Students will practice reading closely as they analyze the highly popular novel The Lightning Thief by Rick Riordan (780L). Some students may have read this text; this unit pushes them to read \u201cdifferently\u201d: reading closely (with a focus on vocabulary), character analysis, and Percy Jackson as an archetypical hero. In their Mid-Unit Assessment, students will read and analyze a previously unfamiliar excerpt from The Lightning Thief, citing specific evidence about how Percy responds to new challenges and explaining what they can infer about Percy as a character. During the second half of the unit, students will read complex informational text about the \u201chero\u2019s journey\u201d archetype, and then\u2014through writing and discussion\u2014use this archetype as a lens to understanding Percy\u2019s experiences. At the end of this unit, students will complete an on-demand graphic organizer and write a short response in which they read a new excerpt of the novel and explain how Percy\u2019s experience aligns with the hero\u2019s journey, citing evidence from both the novel and informational text.",

While they continue to read The Lightning Thief independently, students will closely read multiple myths. In the first half of the unit, they will use the informational text \u201cKey Elements of Mythology\u201d to better understand the elements and themes of the myths they read. In their mid-unit assessment, students will read the myth of Prometheus and write an analytical mini-essay identifying the elements of mythology present in the myth, describing a theme of the myth, and explaining how key details contribute to the theme. In the second half of the unit, students will read, think, talk, and write the myths alluded to in The Lightning Thief. They will determine the themes of myths and how the themes align with themes in the novel.. As students build toward writing a literary analysis, the teacher will model writing skills using the myth of . Students practice these skills using myths they are reading in small, expert groups. For their end of unit assessment, students will write a literary analysis summarizing the myth of \u201cCronus,\u201d identifying a common theme between the myth of \u201cCronus\u201d and The Lightning Thief, and explaining why the author chose to include this myth in the novel.",

Students write their own \u201chero\u2019s journey\u201d narrative that follows the stages of the archetypal hero\u2019s journey and contains elements and a theme of classic mythology. Students revisit the informational text \u201cThe Hero\u2019s Journey\u201d from Unit 1 and use this in the planning of their own narrative. This serves as scaffolding toward the Final Performance Task. For the mid-unit assessment, students write an expository paragraph in which they explain the ways in which their narrative follows the archetype. Students then engage in a series of writer\u2019s craft lessons around narrative writing as they draft their narratives. As an end of unit assessment, students write their best independent drafts of their \u201cMy Hero\u2019s Journey\u201d narrative before they revise and publish it.",

          "description": "Working with Evidence: Rules to Live By What are \u201crules to live by\u201d? How do people formulate and use \u201crules\u201d to improve their lives? How do people communicate these \u201crules\u201d to others? In this module, students consider these questions as they read the novel Bud, Not Buddy, Steve Jobs\u2019 2005 commencement address at Stanford University, President Barack Obama\u2019s Back-to-School Speech, \u201cIf\u201d by Rudyard Kipling, and informational research texts. At the start of Unit 1, students launch their study of Bud, Not Buddy, establishing a set of routines for thinking, writing, and talking about Bud\u2019s rules to live by. They read the novel closely for its figurative language and word choice, analyzing how these affect the tone and meaning of the text. In the second half of the unit, students engage in a close reading of the Steve Jobs speech, focusing on how Jobs develops his ideas at the paragraph, sentence, and word level. Students use details from the speech to develop claims about a larger theme. During Unit 2, students continue to explore the theme of \u201crules to live by\u201d in the novel as well as through close reading of the poem \u201cIf\u201d by Rudyard Kipling. Students analyze how the structure of a poem contributes to its meaning and theme. In a mid-unit assessment, students compare and contrast how Bud, Not Buddy and \u201cIf\u201d address a similar theme. Unit 2 culminates with students writing a literary argument essay in which they establish a claim about how Bud uses his \u201crules\u201d: to survive or to thrive. Students substantiate their claim using specific text-based evidence including relevant details and direct quotations from the novel. In Unit 3, students shift their focus to their own rules to live by and conduct a short research project. Students work in expert groups (research teams) to use multiple informational sources to research that topic. As a final performance task, students use their research to write an essay to inform about one important \u201crule to live by\u201d supported with facts, definitions, concrete details, quotations, and examples. This performance task centers on NYSP12 ELA CCSS RI.6.1, RI.6.2, W.6.2, W.6.4, W.6.5, W.6.9, L.6.1 and L.6.2.",

Students will get to know Bud by looking at the challenges he faces and his response to those challenges. They will read excerpts of the novel closely to interpret figurative language and explain how Bud\u2019s use of figurative language and his word choice affect tone and meaning. Another view into Bud\u2019s character is his \u201cRules to Live By,\u201d which students will analyze: They will consider what various rules mean, determine whether specific rules are meant to help him survive or thrive, and make an inference about where the rule might have originated (in terms of Bud\u2019s experiences). In the mid-unit assessment, students will read a new excerpt from the novel: They will determine the meaning of a simile used by the author, examples of word choices the author makes, and analyze a new a \u201crule\u201d of Bud\u2019s. In the second half of the unit, students continue their exploration of the idea of \u201crules to live by\u201d through close reading of real-world examples: speeches. Through a series of reading cycles, students identify Steve Jobs\u2019 \u201crules to live by\u201d that he articulates in his commencement address at Stanford University. They analyze how structure and word choice add to the meaning of Jobs\u2019 ideas. Finally, students use a focusing question and important details to form an evidence-based claim about the speech. (The lessons related to the Steve Jobs speech are adapted from Odell Education.) Students will then apply these same skills of analyzing text structure and word choice to the end of unit assessment, in which they read Barack Obama\u2019s Back-to-School Speech.",

                  "description": "In this lesson, students are introduced to the Steve Jobs speech. This lesson is the first in a two-lesson cycle that will be repeated until students have read the whole speech closely. In this first lesson of the cycle, they listen to Steve Jobs delivering a section of the speech while following along in their own text. Then they find the gist and identify the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary in a short extract. In the second lesson, they dig deeper into the short extract by answering text-dependent questions. \t\u2022 Lessons 6-11 of Unit 1 are based heavily on the Making Evidence-Based Claims units developed by Odell Education. For the original Odell Education units, go to www.odelleducation.com/resources. \t\u2022 Students use the Reading Closely: Guiding Questions handout to guide their reading for gist. Students should be familiar with this resource from Module 1. It is included again for easy reference. \t\u2022 Due to time constraints, students do not read Paragraphs 2\u20135 closely for gist or to identify the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary from context; however, students may struggle with the following vocabulary in Paragraphs 2\u20135: relented, naively, tuition, intuition, subtle destiny, karma.",

              "description": "In the first half of this second unit, students continue to explore the topic of \u201crules to live by\u201d as they closely read the poem \u201cIf \u201d by Rudyard Kipling. Students determine themes of the poem, consider what \u201crules to live by\u201d Rudyard Kipling is communicating, and analyze how individual stanzas contribute to the poem\u2019s overall meaning. They compare the experience of reading the poem and listening to it read aloud, noticing the importance of pacing and intonation. Finally, students compare and contrast approaches to theme between the poem and the novel. In the mid-unit assessment, students will read a new excerpt of \u201cIf,\u201d analyze how that stanza contributes to the overall meaning of the poem, determine a theme communicated in that stanza, and compare and contrast how that theme is communicated in Bud, Not Buddy. In the second half of Unit 2, students return to a close reading of the novel as they prepare to write a literary argument essay about the nature of \u201cBud\u2019s Rules.\u201d Throughout the unit, as students read Bud, Not Buddy, they continue to pay close attention and keep track of how the plot unfolds as Bud responds to each new experience and person he encounters on his journey. Specifically, they continue to think, talk, and write about the nature of his rules. For the end of unit assessment, students write a literary argument essay in which they establish a claim about how Bud uses his rules: to survive or to thrive. Students substantiate their claim using specific text-based evidence. The formal start of Unit 3 is contained in two lessons of this unit in order to give teachers time to read and provide feedback on the end of unit assessment. This unit also launches an independent reading routine. The series of lessons for launching independent reading can be found as a stand-alone document. Teachers should consider launching this once students have completed reading Bud, Not Buddy after the mid-unit assessment.",

As a result, before students answer questions\u00a0about the meaning of the stanza of the poem in part two of the assessment, there is a vocabulary discussion that is not part of the assessment. This ensures students are familiar with most of the vocabulary before they have to answer questions about the\u00a0meaning of the stanza. \t\u2022 Assess student responses on the mid-unit assessment using the Grade 6 2-Point Rubric\u2014Short Response and the answer key in the supporting materials of this lesson.",

One of the rules will be used for the class model, so the remaining 10 rules will be reviewed by students. The purpose of the Gallery Walk is for students to have a chance to review and analyze all the rules and make a claim about them. \t\u2022 The Gallery Walk is silent so students can have a quiet space as they read and think about each rule and analyze how best to use the text evidence.

Without researched evidence to support it, people have little reason to trust or listen to their rule. \t\u2022 It is also important that students understand that the reason they research before determining their final rule is because they need to make sure that their rule has research evidence to support it. \t\u2022 As the speaking and listening standard SL.6.1 is assessed in Unit 3, students practice the skills outlined in that standard. In\u00a0 \tsome of the lessons in Unit 3, students follow a similar plan\u2014first they listen to a scripted model discussion; then they identify how the discussion was effective; and finally, they practice the skills they have learned through the model in a group discussion with a focus question. In this lesson, the focus is on questions to encourage the speaker to clarify and elaborate his/her ideas, and also on paraphrasing back to check for understanding. \t\u2022 Students are introduced to the research topics in this lesson, and at the end of the lesson they choose a topic to focus their research on. Collect the exit tickets at the end of the lesson and use student choices to put them into research teams in preparation for the next lesson.",

          "description": "Voices of Adversity In this eight-week module, students explore the idea of adversity of people across time and place, and through multiple modes of writing. Students begin this module with a research-based unit on the Middle Ages. They read informational articles about various aspects of medieval life, learning and practicing the skills of summarizing an article, analyzing how ideas are developed across a text, and describing how a part of a text contributes to the whole. Students then break into expert groups to read closely about one demographic group. They practice the informational reading skills they have learned and explore the adversities faced by that group. In the second half of Unit 1, students write an informational essay based on their research as their end of unit assessment. In Unit 2, students use their background knowledge built during Unit 1, but move to reading literature: Good Masters! Sweet Ladies! Voices from a Medieval Village. This is a book of monologues told from the perspective of children living in the same village during the Middle Ages. Students have dual tasks: First, they identify the various adversities faced by this cast of characters; secondly, they examine\u00a0the author\u2019s craft, specifically by identifying and interpreting figurative language in the monologues as well as analyzing how word choices affect the tone of the text. In the second half of Unit 2, students write a literary argument to address the question \u201cDo we struggle with the same adversities as the people of Good Masters! Sweet Ladies!?\u201d In Unit 3, students move into modern voices of adversity by reading concrete poems in the books Blue Lipstick and Technically, It\u2019s Not My Fault. These concrete poems highlight adversities faced by the speakers of the poems, an adolescent girl and her younger brother. Students apply the same reading skills they learned in the reading of Unit 2, but this unit is discussion-based, allowing teachers to assess students\u2019 speaking and listening skills in small group discussions about the texts. For their performance task, students choose a writing format\u2014narrative, like the monologues of Good Masters! Sweet Ladies!, or concrete poem\u2014and write their own text about adversities faced by sixth-graders. Students then perform their writing for a group of their peers. This task addresses NYSP12 ELA CCLS W.6.3, SL.6.4, SL.6.6, L.6.1, L.6.3, and L.6.6.",

Students will begin reading Laurence Yep\u2019s Dragonwings (870L), a high-interest novel about an eight-year old boy from China who joins his father in San Francisco in the early 1900s. As they read the novel, students will also read excerpts of Laurence Yep\u2019s biography The Lost Garden in order to determine how his culture and experiences have shaped his perspective, and how his perspective is\u00a0evident in Dragonwings. Through the close reading of these texts, students will learn multiple strategies for acquiring and using academic vocabulary. At the end of Unit 1, having read half of the novel, students will write a literary analysis explaining how being brought up in a Chinese family in San Francisco affected Laurence Yep\u2019s perspective of Chinese immigrants living in San Francisco, supported by details from Dragonwings that show evidence of his perspective.",

Students continue reading and discussing Dragonwings, but now also dig in more deeply to informational text about this time and place in history. Students are involved in a study of how a point of view is conveyed in an informational text about the earthquake and how an author introduces, illustrates, and elaborates on a topic within an excerpt of text. Students will read excerpts of \u201cComprehending the Calamity,\u201d an informative report of the 1906 earthquake and fire by Emma Burke, who lived in San Francisco at the time and experienced the earthquake. As they read the excerpts, students will identify her point of view of particular aspects of the event like the earthquake itself, the immediate aftermath, and the relief camps. They will also analyze how Burke introduces, illustrates, and elaborates on each of these aspects of the earthquake in the excerpts. In the second half of the unit, students write an essay explaining how the author\u2019s purpose affects point of view. They compare and contrast Emma Burke\u2019s point of view of the immediate aftermath of the earthquake with Moon Shadow\u2019s point of view of the immediate aftermath and explain how they are different as a result of the author\u2019s purpose.",

The unit informally begins in Lessons 12 and 13 of Unit 2 (while teachers assess students\u2019 literary analysis essays). Students begin by researching factual information and eyewitness accounts and collecting what they find on graphic organizers. Students also read literary texts about the earthquake and fires and make connections between the ideas in those texts. In the second half of the unit,\u00a0students analyze newspaper articles in order to learn about the features of a newspaper article. Students then evaluate the information and quotes they have collected through research to determine an angle for their article. They organize their information to write a newspaper article to answer the research question, following the inverted pyramid structure\u2014where the most important information is at the beginning.",

          "description": "In this eight-week, research-based module, students explore the benefits and harmful consequences of the use of the controversial pesticide DDT. In Unit 1, students begin the novel Frightful\u2019s Mountain (640L) by Jean Craighead George. Students will read closely to practice citing evidence and drawing inferences from this compelling text as they begin to think about the interactions between people and the natural world. They also will read informational texts and watch videos to gather evidence and trace arguments about the uses, benefits, and harmful consequences of DDT, its affects on the environment, and its use in the battle against malaria. At the end of this unit, students will participate in a Fishbowl discussion to begin to articulate their evidence-based opinions about the central question: \u201cDo the benefits of DDT outweigh its harmful consequences?\u201d In Unit 2, students will read the remainder of the novel, focusing on the how the main character, Frightful, is affected by the actions of other people and her own interactions with the natural world. Students also will engage in a research project, continuing to explore the central question of the module. Students will read several complex texts, both print and digital, in order to collect relevant information in a structured researcher\u2019s notebook. To help them grapple with this issue, students learn a decision-making process called \u201cStakeholder Consequences Decision-Making\u201d (see the end of this document for details). This process will help students understand the implications of various choices, and will scaffold their ability to determine\u2014based on evidence and their own values\u2014what they believe can and should happen. Unit 2 culminates with students synthesizing all their reading thus far in order to make and present their own evidence-based claim about the use of DDT. In Unit 3, students choose the most compelling evidence and write a position paper in which they support the claim they made (at the end of Unit 2). As a mid-unit assessment, students will submit their best draft of this position paper. As an end of unit assessment, students will submit a published copy, as well as a reflection on the writing process. As the final performance task, students share their findings by creating a scientific poster and presenting that poster to peers during a hosted gallery. This task addresses NYSP12 ELA CCLS R.6.1, W.6.1, W.6.4, W.6.4, and L.6.6.",

              "description": "In this first unit, students are introduced to the central theme of this module: the delicate balance between human needs and the needs of the natural world. Students launch their reading of Frightful\u2019s Mountain, focusing their learning about the natural world by reading through the perspective of Frightful, a peregrine falcon. Students then begin to analyze informational texts and videos about DDT, a pesticide used widely throughout the world to fight malaria, but banned in the United States in 1972 due to its harmful environmental consequences. In these articles and videos, students to learn to trace and evaluate an author\u2019s argument, claims, and evidence. In the mid-unit assessment, students read a new informational article and watch a new video, completing a graphic organizer\u00a0identical to the one they have been using to trace the author\u2019s argument during lessons. In the second half of the unit, students grapple with the central question of this module: Do the benefits of DDT outweigh its harmful consequences? Students reflect on the novel, the articles they read, and the videos they watched as well as a variety of new visual information in the form of charts, graphs, and maps. For their end of unit assessment, students participate in a Fishbowl discussion in which they are expected to advocate their position in response to the central question, using their own visual aids to help them support their position. This unit uses science content to teach literacy standards, but is not intended to replace hands-on science instruction.",

              "description": "In this unit, students grapple with the question \u201cDo the benefits of DDT outweigh its harmful consequences?\u201d In the first half of the unit, students use a guided researcher\u2019s notebook, research folder, and a WebQuest to research informational texts about DDT\u2019s benefits and harmful consequences. The researcher\u2019s notebook requires students to cite their sources, assess the credibility of each source, paraphrase the information relevant to their research question, and decide if the evidence from their research changes the focus of their inquiry. Students also analyze an author\u2019s presentation of information and ideas, and then compare and contrast that presentation of information and ideas with the presentation by another author. Additionally, students revisit strategies they have learned throughout the year to address new vocabulary: context clues, affixes, and resource materials such as dictionaries and thesauruses.. In their mid-unit assessment, students read two unfamiliar informational articles about DDT. They complete a page identical to their researcher\u2019s notebook for one article, as well as a graphic\u00a0organizer in which they compare and contrast the presentation of ideas in these two articles. In the second half of the unit, students work toward making a claim based on the evidence of their research, a similar skill to the work of Module 2 in which students made a claim on which they built a literary argument. Students learn the important skill of sifting through all the materials they have thus far encountered, deciding what is relevant to their research question and what is not. They use a Cascading Consequences chart, visually tracking the chain reaction of a decision, and a Stakeholders chart, tracking who is affected by a decision, as integral tools in making their claim. After reviewing research, considering a particular decision\u2019s consequences, and who it affects, students draft and revise a claim about the use of DDT. In their end of unit assessment, students are asked to orally present their final claim to an audience and include the use of multimedia components such as charts and graphs. This claim will launch students in their argument writing of Unit 3.",

In the first half of the unit, students analyze a model position paper and plan their own, with several opportunities to talk through their ideas as well as get feedback to improve their plans. The mid-unit assessment is students\u2019 best draft of their position paper.\u00a0 In the second half of the unit, students revise their position papers based on teacher feedback. They also receive lessons on the use of grade-level-appropriate vocabulary and formal English in writing. The end of unit assessment is students\u2019 published position paper as well as a student reflection on the process of writing the paper, using evidence from the students\u2019 own work. Finally, students engage in the performance task: creating a scientific poster based on their position paper. They share this poster with their classmates in a hosted Gallery Walk.",

          "description": "Overview \tThe Researching to Deepen Understanding units lay out an inquiry process through which students learn how to deepen their understanding of\u00a0topics. Students pose and refine inquiry questions, exploring areas they wish to investigate. They find and\u00a0assess\u00a0sources\u00a0and\u00a0organize\u00a0researched material in ways that will support their analysis and integration of information. As their inquiry\u00a0progresses, they\u00a0evaluate and extend their research, synthesize their information, and eventually express their evolving evidence-based\u00a0perspective. This unit approaches research as an iterative inquiry process for deepening understanding of a topic in order to develop an evidence-based perspective. Given that students in grade 6 are not expected by the CCSS to perform independent searches, this unit outlines a simulated research process that relies strongly on collaborative work around a common topic. A topic resource repository about prehistoric art is provided to help teachers model the process with a rich selection of sources, as well as model tools and inquiry questions.

          "description": "In this 8 eight-week module, students explore the experiences of people of Southern Sudan during and after the Second Sudanese Civil War. They build proficiency in using textual evidence to support ideas in their writing, both in shorter responses and in an extended essay. In Unit 1, students begin the novel A Long Walk to Water (720L) by Linda Sue Park. Students will read closely to practice citing evidence and drawing inferences from this compelling text as they begin to analyze and contrast the points of view of the two central characters, Salva and Nya. They also will read informational text to gather evidence on the perspectives of the Dinka and Nuer tribes of Southern Sudan. In Unit 2, students will read the remainder of the novel, focusing on the commonalities between Salva and Nya in relation to the novel\u2019s theme: how individuals survive in challenging environments. (The main characters\u2019 journeys are fraught with challenges imposed by the environment, including the lack of safe drinking water, threats posed by animals, and the constant scarcity of food. They are also challenged by political and social environments.). As in Unit 1, students will read this literature closely alongside complex informational texts (focusing on background on Sudan and factual accounts of the experiences of refugees from the Second Sudanese Civil War). Unit 2 culminates with a literary analysis essay about the theme of survival. Unit 3 brings students back to a deep exploration of character and point of view: students will combine their research about Sudan with specific quotes from A Long Walk to Water as they craft a two-voice poem, comparing and contrasting the points of view of the two main characters, Salva and Nya,. The two-voice poem gives students an opportunity to use both their analysis of the characters and theme in the novel and their research about the experiences of the people of Southern Sudan during the Second Sudanese Civil War. This task addresses NYSP12 ELA Standards RL.7.6, RL.7.11, W.7.3, W.7.4, W.7.5, W.7.8, W.7.9, L.7.1, and L.7.2.",

In this unit, students will read the first five chapters of the novel, discovering the differing perspectives of the novel\u2019s two main characters and considering the different experiences of the Dinka and Nuer tribes of Southern Sudan. Students will then explore informational texts that describe the cultures of the Dinka and the Nuer. Students will identify textual evidence that supports the differing perspectives of the novel\u2019s characters and the Sudanese people, and do routine writing tasks to analyze and explain that evidence. (This will lay the foundation for a rich performance task in Unit 3 in which students synthesize their understanding of character point of view in a two-voice poem.) Throughout this unit, students build their ability to read closely and to analyze textual evidence in writing. This unit also introduces important discussion protocols that help students collaborate effectively during discussions. For the Mid-Unit and End of Unit Assessments in Unit 1, students will demonstrate their abilities to gather textual evidence that highlights the different perspectives from their readings.",

As they complete A Long Walk to Water, students will continue to collect textual evidence to answer the question \u201cHow do individuals survive in challenging environments?\u201d In addition, students will be reading informational texts that provide more information about the context of the novel. Close reading of the selected informational text and novel will prepare students for the mid-unit assessment and the two-part end of unit assessment. For the mid-unit assessment, students will analyze how the author of A Long Walk to Water both used and elaborated on historical facts. Part 1 of the end of unit assessment (which takes place over two lessons) is the first draft of a literary analysis essay requiring textual support to discuss the topic of survival in Southern Sudan during and after the second civil war in the 1980s. Part 2 of the end of unit assessment is the final draft of the student essay.",

Students will be pulling textual evidence from the novel and informational texts to create a two-voice poem. The poem will feature the voices of the two main characters in the novel, Salva and Nya. The mid- and end of unit assessments will prepare students for the Final Performance Task by having them look at the author\u2019s craft using juxtaposition to illustrate the two personalities and organize their thoughts before beginning work on their poems. In preparation for creating their poems, students will also examine models of two-voice poems. Once the poems are written, they will be shared with an audience of their classmates or others beyond their classroom. Teachers will assess the finished poems using a rubric adapted from the NYS Grade 6\u20138 Expository Writing Evaluation Rubric.",

          "description": "Working with Evidence: Working Conditions Then and Now In this module, students explore the issue of working conditions, both historical and modern day. As they read and discuss both literary and informational text, students analyze how people, settings, and events interact in a text and how an author develops a central claim. Students strengthen their ability to discuss specific passages from a text with a partner, write extended text-based argument and informational pieces, and conduct a short research project. At the end of the module, students will have a better understanding of how working conditions affect workers and the role that workers, the government, consumers, and businesses play in improving working conditions. The first unit focuses on Lyddie, a novel that tells the story of a young girl who goes to work in the Lowell mills, and explores the issue of working conditions in industrializing America. This unit builds students\u2019 background knowledge about working conditions and how they affect workers, and centers on the standard RL.7.3, which is about how plot, character, and setting interact in literature. As an end of unit assessment, students write an argument essay about Lyddie\u2019s choices regarding her participation in the protest over working conditions. The second unit moves to more recent history and considers the role that workers, the government, and consumers all play in improving working conditions. The central text in Unit 2 is a speech by C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez, in which he explains how the United Farm Workers empowered farmworkers. Unit 2 focuses on reading informational text, and students practice identifying central ideas in a text, analyzing how an author develops his claims, and identifying how the sections of the text combine to build those ideas. This unit intentionally builds on Odell Education\u2019s work, and if teachers have already used the Ch\u00e1vez speech and lessons, an alternate text is suggested with which to teach the same informational text standards. In the End of Unit 2 Assessment, students apply their understanding of text structure to a new speech. Unit 3 focuses on the research standards (W.7.7 and W.7.8): through an investigation of working conditions in the modern day garment industry, students explore how businesses can affect working conditions, both positively and negatively. As a final performance task, students create a consumer\u2019s guide to working conditions in the garment industry. This teenage consumer\u2019s guide provides an overview of working conditions and offers advice to consumers who are interested in working conditions in the garment industry. This task focuses on NYSP12 ELA Standards W.7.2a, b, d, f, W.7.4, W.7.6, W.7.7, W.7.8, L.7.3, and L.7.6",

The unit begins with a lesson that engages students in the guiding questions about working conditions that connect all three units in the module. Students then read the novel Lyddie,\u00a0about a girl who goes to work in the Lowell mills, with an emphasis on CCLS RL.7.3, which is about how plot, character, and setting interact in literature. As students read the novel, they build their stamina and capacity for independent reading of complex texts. In class, they do a variety of close reading, fluency, and vocabulary exercises with critical passages from the text. This work with particular passages builds the text-based discussion skills referenced in SL.7.1, as it pushes students to collaborate to analyze specific passages from the novel. For the mid-unit assessment, students read a new chapter of the book and answer selected- and \u00a0structed response\u00a0items about how working conditions in the mill affect Lyddie. In the second part of the unit, students evaluate Lyddie\u2019s choices around joining the protest over working conditions. As students read, they track factors in her decision, and then they craft an argument about whether or not she should sign the petition. The end of unit assessment is an argument essay about this question. This essay follows a similar process to that used in Module 1, Unit 2, but it pushes students to greater independence with the process of crafting and revising an extended analytical essay. As with\u00a0the Module 1 essay, the first draft is graded for content and evidence, and the second draft is graded for organization and conventions (this time with a particular focus on L.7.1, sentence structure). As students read Lyddie, they are encouraged to generate questions about how working conditions have or have not changed. These questions will drive students\u2019 research about the modern-day garment industry in Unit 3.",

                  "description": "In this lesson, students begin to read Lyddie, the central text of Unit 1. This unit focuses on standard RL.7.3: Students will analyze how the plot, setting, and characters in Lyddie interact. In this lesson, they learn these terms and apply them to the first chapter of Lyddie. \t\u2022 As explained in more detail in the Unit 1 Overview, Lyddie is a more complex text than A Long Walk to Water, and students move through the book fairly rapidly, doing substantial reading for homework. All students, even readers at grade level, will need your\u00a0support in developing their stamina and independence with complex text during this unit. Consider how your existing routines and class culture around celebrating homework completion and effort might be used to support and encourage students as they\u00a0read Lyddie. \t\u2022 Also be sure to read the text in advance and consider what supports your students will need to understand it. See the Unit 1 Overview for a list of ways to support struggling readers and determine what will be most effective for your students. \t\u2022 The sequence of homework, lessons, and assessments in this unit has been carefully designed to provide appropriate supports during class and to make sure that students who are struggling with reading complex text at home will not be unduly disadvantaged on assessments. The sections of the book that students focus on during class are the sections most relevant to assessment tasks. \t\u2022 The homework routine is designed to support students in a first read of a given section of text. (Then in class, students reread the most central sections of the text.) The Reader\u2019s Notes that students complete as they read for homework and the daily Checking for Understanding entry task that begins class the next day provide students with structures that help them make meaning of the text and then check to make sure their understanding is accurate. \t\u2022 In this lesson, students have guided practice with the Reader\u2019s Notes that they will use throughout their reading of the novel. The Reader\u2019s Notes for Lyddie are similar to those for A Long Walk to Water from Module 1. As they read, students take gist\u00a0notes (though this time they are organized by character, setting, and plot) and keep track of the new vocabulary they encounter. As suggested in the Unit 1 Overview, decide how you will organize, check, and collect Reader\u2019s Notes for Lyddie. Consider\u00a0checking the work most days but collecting it periodically to look it over more thoroughly. Lesson plans assume that students have the Reader\u2019s Notes as three packets and that they will turn in each packet for feedback as it is completed: Chapters 1\u20137;\u00a0Chapters 8\u201317; and Chapters 18\u201325. After evaluating their work, return these packets to students so they can refer to them as they write their essays. It is possible to organize the Reader\u2019s Notes differently to meet the needs of your students. \t\u2022 The Reader\u2019s Notes that students will use for homework are attached to the lesson in which the homework is assigned, as is the Teacher\u2019s Edition of those chapters. You will need the Teacher\u2019s Edition the next day to review vocabulary.",

Students watch you model how to use the Reader\u2019s\u00a0Notes to complete the daily Checking for Understanding entry task, as well as strategies students might use to make meaning of this text when reading for homework. \t\u2022 The lesson provides significant scripting as a resource for teachers. However, consider what type of modeling will best support your students and adapt the modeling to meet their needs. \t\u2022 This lesson introduces the Checking for Understanding entry task. In this routine, students answer several questions about the previous night\u2019s homework using only their Reader\u2019s Notes (not the book). Decide how you want to collect these and use the information, and communicate that clearly to students in this lesson. Especially during the first part of the unit, consider the entry task as useful formative data to guide your instruction (rather than as an assessment to be counted for a grade). Also encourage students to use the entry task as self-checks: If they can answer the questions correctly, they are understanding the reading they are doing for homework; if they cannot, they should consider how they might change their homework practices (for example, by doing more rereading).",

Be deliberate in grouping students to ensure that all groups will be successful. \t\u2022 Modeling the Gallery Walk with the interactive slide show is a crucial step of the process. Not only will it help the class understand the task, but it will also illustrate the range of working conditions students will explore in this module. \t\u2022 The students are introduced to the Working Conditions anchor chart at the end of this lesson. The homework will help familiarize them with the categories on the chart. Because the class will work extensively with this chart in subsequent lessons, \tnot a lot of time is devoted to it now.",

In the design of this lesson and the lessons that follow, the following criteria were used to define argument writing: \t* The goal of argument writing is for the reader to acknowledge the validity of the claim (not necessarily be persuaded by it). \t* Appropriate evidence is used and analyzed logically to support the claim. This evidence is usually organized into reasons. \t* The author considers the reasons and evidence for them before articulating the claim. \t* The author acknowledges a counterargument in his or her writing. \t\u2022 The model essay is about the decision that Lyddie makes to go to Lowell to work in the mills. The model essay is intentionally written about the same text (Lyddie) that students also will write about so that students are familiar with the context. However,\u00a0the model essay does not use exactly the same examples and information that the student essay will use. \t\u2022 Students will need the model essay in subsequent lessons, so ask them to keep their copy. \t\u2022 The writing process for the argument essay is similar to that of Module 1. The rubric for this assignment is based closely on the New York State Expository Writing Rubric. Because the students are already familiar with that rubric, the rubric analysis built\u00a0into these lessons will not be as in-depth as it was in Module 1.",

By the end of the lesson, they will write the claim in their essay and the reasons they will use. To help students decide which claim to argue, they will weigh the reasons and text code the Forming Evidence- \tBased Claims graphic organizers that they used in Lessons 10\u201312. These were collected in Lesson 12. Be prepared to return them with feedback and to use the data they provided to inform your instructional decisions over the next several lessons about\u00a0where students may need additional support. \t\u2022 In order to teach students how to choose the most compelling and well-supported reasons for their essay, this lesson includes the Take a Stand protocol that they first did in Module 1, Unit 2, Lesson 4. For this lesson, the protocol will be changed in small\u00a0ways. Instead of using it to agree or disagree, students will move depending on whether they think Statement A or Statement B is stronger (see Work Time Part A). This is a chance for students to physically move around while learning this crucial step in\u00a0the argument writing process.",

                  "description": "In this lesson, students analyze the model argument essay in more depth than they did in Lesson 13. Students focus on the model essay in this lesson because, unlike with narrative writing, students generally do not have lots of experience reading argument writing. To be able to write in a particular form, students need to have a deep understanding of its elements. \t\u2022 Students need a model to emulate in order to successfully push their writing, much like a basketball player imitating the moves of a professional in order to improve his or her play. It is good for students to imitate the structure of a model argument essay\u00a0to show they can do the thinking that an argument essay requires. To make sure the students are assessed on their own thinking, the model essay is focused on another decision that Lyddie makes. It is similar to the essay prompt, but students will not be able\u00a0to use the ideas in the model essay in their own writing. \t\u2022 The goal of students\u2019 analysis of the model is to be sure they understand the claim, reasons, use of evidence, and the structure of an argument essay. Students reread the model several times, each time with a different purpose. Rereading will help students\u00a0internalize the model essay, supporting their own essay writing in Lesson 18. \t\u2022 In their own essay later in this unit, students will build on the skills they developed in Module 1, including the use of quotes. In Module 1, the focus was on students citing and punctuating quotes correctly (see Module 1, Unit 2, Lesson 11). Students are\u00a0expected to continue to do this. But the new learning focus here is specifically on how to use a \u201cquote sandwich.\u201d",

              "description": "In this unit, which centers on informational text standards RI.7.2, RI.7.3, and RI.7.5, students will read and analyze a speech by C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez. In response to the difficult working and living conditions faced by agricultural workers, Ch\u00e1vez helped found the United Farm Workers in the 1960s. In 1984, Ch\u00e1vez gave his Commonwealth Club Address, which argues that the UFW has been and will continue to be a powerful institution that improves the lives of farmworkers and empowers the Latino community. This is primarily a reading unit, and it focuses on students\u2019 ability to determine the central ideas of a text and analyze how they are developed, understand how people and events interact in that text, and consider how an author organizes a text so that each section of the text relates to the central claim. As students read the speech, they will add to a new anchor chart about how consumers, workers, government, and businesses (the focus of Unit 3) affect working conditions. They also will analyze how Ch\u00e1vez uses specific tools of rhetoric to develop his central claim and will discuss the structure of the speech. In the Mid- Unit 2 Assessment, students will answer selected-response questions for a section of Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s speech that the class has not yet discussed. In the End of Unit 2 Assessment, they will apply their understanding of text structure to analyze a new speech by Ch\u00e1vez. Both assessments focus on RI.7.2, RI.7.3, and RI.7.5, but the mid-unit assessment focuses more on RI.7.2 and RI.7.3 while the end of unit assessment focuses more on RI.7.5. The lessons in this unit are adapted from lessons developed by Odell Education (see stand-alone documents on EngageNY.org).",

                  "description": "In this lesson, students are introduced to the guiding question of Unit 2: Who changes working conditions? The students will think about this individually, in groups, and as a class. Students will capture their thinking on a class anchor chart. \t\u2022 Students are also introduced to C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez. Consider adapting the Building Background Knowledge Worksheet (see supporting materials) to suit the source you choose. Building students\u2019 understanding of the context in which Chavez gives his\u00a0speech will help their comprehension of the speech, and allow them to move on to the structural analysis of a complex text that is the core cognitive work of this unit. This lesson recommends using the picture book Harvesting Hope: The Story of C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez\u00a0by Kathleen Krull; alternatives are listed below. Consider what will be best for your situation.\u00a0 \t\u2022 This lesson also includes time to discuss the issues of language and ethnicity with students, as the words we use to refer to groups have changed over the years. If you are new to this type of conversation with students, consider talking in advance with\u00a0a colleague about how to facilitate this part of the lesson. \t\u2022 Because this unit requires a lot of in-class reading, many lessons\u2014including this one\u2014include an activity that involves movement to give students a physical break. When you implement lessons with these types of activities, make sure to review\u00a0your expectations for how and when students move around the classroom just before starting the activity. Descriptions of what you should and should not hear and see will help students be successful. \t\u2022 For homework in this unit, students are usually reading in their independent reading book. The plans assume that you have launched the independent reading program with your students, and that all students have books to read and understand the\u00a0routines of reading and logging their reading. See two separate stand-alone documents on EngageNY.org: The Importance of Increasing the Volume of Reading, and Launching Independent Reading in Grades 6\u20138: Sample Plan, which together provide\u00a0the rationale and practical guidance for a robust independent reading program.

                  "description": "Unit 2 Lessons 2-7 are adapted from the Making Evidence-Based Claims unit developed by Odell Education. For the original Odell Education unit, go to www.odelleducation.com/resources. \t\u2022 In this lesson, students will begin to work with the central text, C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s Commonwealth Club Address (1984). This text is challenging. Therefore, students will first read and listen to large chunks of the speech for gist. Then they will reread and analyze\u00a0each selection in greater depth. \t\u2022 In this lesson, students read along as they listen to a recording of Chavez delivering the first half of the speech (paragraphs 1 \u2013 15). This is a powerful way for the students to connect with the text. \t\u2022 Then students dive deeper into the first eight paragraphs of the Commonwealth Club Address to analyze one of Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s claims. In Unit 1, students formed evidence-based claims after collecting evidence. Here they reverse that process: hey are given\u00a0the claim but must find evidence to support it. The examples provided in the teacher versions are possibilities meant more to \u00a0illustrate the process than to shape textual analysis. Instruction will be most effective if the evidence used in modeling flows\u00a0naturally from the textual ideas and details that you and the students find significant and interesting. \t\u2022 Students use a Forming Evidence-based claims graphic organizer (similar to ones they used in Module 1). This graphic organizer is adapted in collaboration with Odell Education based on their Evidence-Based Claims worksheet (also see standalone\u00a0document on EngageNY.org and odelleducation.com/resources). \t\u2022 In this unit, students often hold their thinking by annotating their text. Because students may have little experience with annotating text, consider displaying your own copy of the text on a document camera and annotating it as you go to provide\u00a0students with a visual model of what their speech should look like. \t\u2022 In this lesson, students begin their work on RI.7.5: understanding how each section of the Ch\u00e1vez speech contributes to his central claim. They begin to work with a graphic organizer that notes the main claim in each part of the speech and has a\u00a0place to note how each section connects to the central claim of the speech. Keep this as a class anchor chart and also provide students with their own copy to take notes on. \t\u2022 Note that in these lessons, the term \u201ccentral claim\u201d is used to refer to the overall claim of Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s speech. As with any argument, his central claim is supported by a number of smaller claims that add together to create his central claim. These \tlessons use the language of \u201cmain claim in the section \u2026\u201d to refer to the smaller claims that together support his central claim. \tBoth central claim and main claim refer to arguments that are supported by evidence or reasons. \t\u2022 Note that Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s central claim is in Paragraph 15, in the middle of the speech. Lead students to understand how this is different from the essays they have written and how a persuasive speech differs in structure from an argumentative essay. In an\u00a0argumentative essay, the central claim is established early. In this speech, it is introduced in the middle.",

They return to Paragraphs 8\u201315 of the Commonwealth Club Address to identify the claims that Ch\u00e1vez makes about the UFW. Students should leave with a firm understanding\u00a0that Ch\u00e1vez believed the UFW changed not just the working conditions of farmworkers, but the lives of all Chicanos. This understanding will help them realize why Ch\u00e1vez can make the claim that the power and influence of the UFW will expand in\u00a0the future. \t\u2022 This lesson is effectively the bridge between the two parts of the speech. In the first part, C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez lays out the past; in the second half, he describes current struggles and the future. Following the pattern established in Lesson 2, students will listen to\u00a0the second half of the speech today and annotate for the gist. \t\u2022 Students also work on RI.7.5 as they relate the first half of the speech to the central claim. \t\u2022 Consider what structure you will use for the independent reading check-in scheduled for Lesson 5; as you review the homework with students, make sure they are clear about what they need to have completed beforehand and what they should bring to class\u00a0that day.",

Then, using skills and concepts developed in Units 1 and 2, students will engage in a short research project on current working conditions in the garment industry. In particular, students will learn to gather relevant information, ask supporting research questions, and paraphrase information from sources. As students research, they will keep track of their notes in the researcher\u2019s notebook. In the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment, students will answer selected-response questions about a research text that the class has not yet discussed. In the End of Unit 3 Assessment, they will synthesize the information they gathered in their research into several paragraphs. Both assessments focus on W.7.7 and W.7.8, but the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment focuses more on gathering relevant information and asking questions, while the end of unit assessment focuses more on paraphrasing and synthesizing information to answer a research question. As a final performance task, students create a consumer\u2019s guide (targeting a teenage audience) to buying clothing. This guide provides an overview of working conditions and explains how consumers might respond to this information. This task focuses on NYSP12 ELA Standards W.7.2, W.7.4, W.7.6, W.7.7, W.7.8, SL.7.1b, L.7.1, L.7.2, L.7.3, and L.7.6.",

You might confer with each pair, pull several pairs to support more intensively, or provide a formal checkpoint for each pair. Students might benefit from a routine in which you ask partners to commit to a goal for the next 15 minutes, then check in to see if they have reached that goal, then set the next goal.",

          "description": "In this module, students explore the concept of personal identity formation and transformation in both historical and modern-day societies. The module begins with an overview of what \u201cidentity\u201d means and how it can mean different things to different people. In Unit 1, students read first-person narratives that focus on various social identifiers\u2014from race to gender to socioeconomic status\u2014as they begin to frame their understanding of what identity means. Students read informational text, identifying central ideas, analyzing how an author develops his or her claims, and identifying how the sections of the text interact to form those ideas. Unit 1 builds students\u2019 background knowledge in preparation for Unit 2, during which students closely read Pygmalion by George Bernard Shaw and further explore the identity transformation of the play\u2019s main character, Eliza Doolittle. This unit centers on standard RL.7.3, which focuses on how plot, character, and setting interact in literature. As an end of unit assessment, students write an argumentative essay about Eliza\u2019s changes internally and externally as she undergoes the experiment of recreating herself under Higgins\u2019 tutelage. In Unit 3, students analyze the impact of gender roles and stereotypes in personal identity development as influenced by the media and advertising. As students read and discuss both literary and informational texts, they strengthen their ability to discuss specific passages from a text with a partner, write extended text-based argumentative and informational pieces, and conduct a short research project. Unit 3 focuses on the research standards W.7.7 and W.7.8 through an investigation of how media and advertising perpetuate stereotypes about gender and affect individuals\u2019 sense of self. As a final performance task, students create an advertisement analysis of a current print ad and modify it by making a \u201ccounter ad\u201d that does not rely on gender-specific stereotypes and instead offers a new vision of what men and women can be. At the end of the module, students will have a better understanding of how society tries to define individuals and how individuals try to define themselves.",

The module focuses on the questions of what makes stories powerful and on understanding an author\u2019s purpose. In addition, students analyze how writers use figurative language and word choice to convey meaning. Alternative\u00a0Children's Book The book, Frederick Douglass: The Last Day of Slavery, is integral to several lessons in this module, and is widely available in public and school libraries. However, a free alternative children\u2019s book, Turning the Page\u2013Frederick Douglass Learns to Read, and corresponding alternate lessons are available within Unit 2 and Unit 3 to accommodate schools/districts that are not able to secure a copy of Frederick Douglass: The Last Day of Slavery.",

              "description": "In this unit, students are introduced to the topic, guiding questions, and central text of the module: Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass (excerpts only). By the end of the unit, they will understand the historical context of this text as well as the tools and processes they will use as they read and analyze it. Their analysis will focus on Douglass\u2019s purpose and how he tells his story in order to accomplish it. In the beginning of the unit, students listen to and discuss The People Could Fly (a picture book by Virginia Hamilton). This book introduces the topic of slavery as well as one of the module\u2019s guiding questions: What gives stories and poems their enduring power? The next set of lessons introduces the central text and its context. Through reading informational texts and working with images, students build their understanding of slavery, the life of Frederick Douglass, and the debate over slavery in which his voice was so significant. In these lessons, students focus on analyzing texts and supporting their analysis with textual evidence (RI.7.1). After a pause to launch independent reading for the module, students begin their work with the Narrative. As they read excerpts from the first two chapters, students consider Douglass\u2019s purposes, practice the routines they will use for reading this text, and notice what gives this story its power. The unit closes with a set of lessons on poetry. Students read poems that deepen their understanding of slavery, and build their ability to recognize and interpret figurative language\u2014skills that will be critical as they continue their reading of Douglass. The End of Unit 1 Assessment focuses on students\u2019 ability to analyze how structures, word choice, and figurative language contribute to a poem\u2019s meaning.",

              "description": "In this unit, students closely read three extended excerpts from Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass. They continue with the same routine that was introduced in Unit 1; it is designed to allow all students to understand this complex text. For each excerpt, the teacher reads the text out loud while students read silently. Next, students do a second read to make sure they understand specific words and literal meaning, then a third read in which they grapple with questions that require more synthesis and analysis, focusing particularly on how Douglass uses language and on those parts of the text that relate most directly to his purpose in writing. Finally, students meet in groups of three to complete an Excerpt Analysis note-catcher, which includes the narrative arc of the excerpt as well as the ways in which this excerpt conveys Douglass\u2019s position. In their analysis of the Narrative, students build on the work from Unit 1 about how authors use word choice and figurative language to convey meaning, and they help construct a word wall that showcases some of Douglass\u2019s powerful language. In their work with author\u2019s purpose, the focus of the textual analysis essay, students continue to refer to the Shining a Light anchor chart from Unit 1. The work with narrative arc is new in this unit; it is launched with the reading of Frederick Douglass: The Last Day of Slavery[1] at the beginning of the unit. It is not an assessed skill; rather, it supports students in understanding the events of the Narrative and serves as a scaffold for the performance task in Unit 3\u2014a children\u2019s book based on one of the excerpts. This unit also includes work in which students compare a written story to how a storyteller might perform that same story (included in the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment) and in understanding how sentences are constructed (L.7.1a, b, c; assessed in Unit 3). The Mid-Unit 2 Assessment focuses on students\u2019 ability to independently analyze a new excerpt of the Narrative, with a particular focus on understanding the words and language used and how they contribute to meaning. The end of unit assessment is an on-demand extended essay about how Douglass conveys his purpose and distinguishes his position from that of those who defend slavery. This essay is similar to the essays in earlier modules, with several days devoted to rereading, analyzing textual evidence, and planning the essay. However, unlike the essays in earlier modules, this essay is not revised: Students use their notes and outlines to write a single draft over two days in class. Note that it is strongly recommended that you do both the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment and the End of Unit 2 Assessment (the essay) yourself near the beginning of this unit. This unit requires precise and rigorous analysis of a complex text. This is work that students are capable of, but many of them will need carefully calibrated support. The more detailed your understanding of the assessments, the better positioned you will be to support your students in the type of thinking they will be doing throughout the lessons. \u00a0  [1] The book, Frederick Douglass: The Last Day of Slavery, is integral to several lessons in this module, and is widely available in public and school libraries.\u00a0However, a free\u00a0alternative children\u2019s book,\u00a0Turning the Page\u2013Frederick Douglass Learns to Read, and corresponding alternate lessons are available within\u00a0Unit 2\u00a0and\u00a0Unit 3\u00a0to accommodate schools/districts that are not able to secure a copy of\u00a0Frederick Douglass: The Last Day of Slavery.",

              "description": "In this unit, students write a picture book based on an event from the life of Frederick Douglass. First, students return to Frederick Douglass: The Last Day of Slavery[1], which they encountered in Unit 2. This children\u2019s book serves as the model text, and the students read it and another children\u2019s book closely to examine how the author used the tools of a narrative writer to craft a powerful story. Students then write their own book through a series of structured lessons, which are designed to help them all produce high-quality work. First, using their notes from Unit 2, they select an episode on which to focus and write a general plan for their story. Then they take those plans to a Writer\u2019s Roundtable, where they discuss their plans and participate in a peer critique. In addition to being a valuable step in the writing process, this structured conversation serves as Part 1 of the mid-unit assessment (focusing on SL.7.1b, c, and d). Also leading up to the mid-unit assessment, students do a variety of learning activities that focus on sentence\u00a0structure and build on the instruction from Unit 2. Part 2 of the mid-unit assessment consists of selected and constructed response centered on L 7.1a, b, d, and 7.2a. Students then begin a series of writer\u2019s workshops. Within these lessons, students continue to learn about narrative writing techniques and the teacher gives a series of mini lessons centered on sensory language, precise word choice, strong verbs, and dialogue. They have class time to write several drafts of each page on storyboards. At various points they revise their writing based on peer review and self-assessment. Next, they turn in their completed storyboards (which serve as the end of unit assessment) for formal teacher feedback. Students also reflect on how they addressed audience and purpose in their stories. After the teacher returns the storyboards with feedback, the students create their illustrated children\u2019s books. This book is the final performance task; students synthesize all they have learned about Frederick Douglass and the power of stories. \u00a0  [1] The book, Frederick Douglass: The Last Day of Slavery, is integral to several lessons in this module, and is widely available in public and school libraries.\u00a0However, a free\u00a0alternative children\u2019s book,\u00a0Turning the Page\u2013Frederick Douglass Learns to Read, and corresponding alternate lessons are available within\u00a0Unit 2\u00a0and\u00a0Unit 3\u00a0to accommodate schools/districts that are not able to secure a copy of\u00a0Frederick Douglass: The Last Day of Slavery.",

          "description": "This eight-week module focuses on a \u201cscience and society\u201d topic, engaging students in reading compelling informational text about adolescent brain development and the effects of entertainment screen time on the brain. In Unit 1, students first read various texts that will build their background knowledge about adolescent brain development in general. Their learning will center around three areas of the brain, namely the prefrontal cortex, the limbic system, and the developing neurons. Students determine main ideas and evidence in diverse media and clarify their learning about this complex content. Then they begin to focus on the issue of screen time and how it may affect teenagers. In Unit 2, they begin to read argument texts. They trace arguments and evaluate the soundness of reasoning and the sufficiency and relevancy of evidence in the texts and media that they engage with in this unit. They dive deeper into first the potential benefits and then the potential risks of screen time by participating in a robust research project. To organize their research sources and information, students use a researcher\u2019s notebook. Then students conduct Internet-based research. Throughout Unit 2, students engage in many conversations to synthesize and clarify their learning. To help students grapple with this issue, the second half of Unit 2 introduces students to a modified decision-making process called Stakeholder Consequences Decision-Making (see the end of this document for details). This process will help students understand the implications of various choices and will scaffold their ability to determine, based on evidence and their own values, what they themselves believe should happen. Unit 3 marks the transition from research to writing as students plan and draft a position paper, addressing the question: \u201cAfter examining both the potential benefits and risks of entertainment screen time, particularly to adolescent development, make a recommendation. Should the AAP raise the recommended daily entertainment screen time from two hours to four hours?\u201d Students have several opportunities for feedback and revision during this unit. As a final performance task, students publish and share a visual representation of their position paper. This task centers on NYSP12 ELA CCLS RI.7.1, W.7.1, W.7.4, and L.7.6.",

They first will learn the basic biology of the brain, focusing on three key aspects of brain development: the prefrontal cortex, the limbic system, and changing neurons. Through a variety of sources, including text, video, and interactive Web sites, they learn that the adolescent brain is growing in a dynamic and unique way. With each source, they will practice analyzing the main idea and supporting details. They also will compare how the same ideas are presented in text and visual formats. This prepares them for their mid-unit assessment, which centers on analyzing the main idea in a video and comparing the video to a text (SL.7.2 and RI.7.7).\u00a0 After the mid-unit assessment, students will begin to examine more specifically, the effects of screen time on the developing brain. They will grapple with a challenging text, which will help them examine the possible positive and negative effects of being \u201cplugged in.\u201d Through carefully designed close readings, students will continue to analyze the main idea and supporting details presented in this text while building their stamina and capacity for a complex text. To help personalize these difficult concepts, in each lesson students will return to an audio slideshow where they hear the voices of students who are immersed in the digital world. Then they read a profile of a student who typifies the positives and negative effects of being \u201cplugged in.\u201d For the end of unit assessment, students will analyze the main idea and supporting ideas in a text that links digital media, brain development, and adolescent behavior (RI.7.1, RI.7.5, and RI.7.6).",

              "description": "In this unit, students will continue to conduct close readings and then engage in independent research into the ways that the developing adolescent brain may be affected by screen time. Students will keep a researcher\u2019s notebook in which they document their research findings, generate supporting research questions, and analyze the credibility of their sources as they determine how different authors use evidence to prove their points. Part 1 of the mid-unit assessment will ask students to analyze and evaluate two arguments: one presented in text and the other presented in a video (RI.7.5, RI.7.8, SL.7.3). Then, in Part 2, students will engage in a simulated research task focused on adolescents and screen time (RI.7.9, W.7.7, W.7.8, L.7.4c, L.7.4d). The assessment will incorporate selected response and short constructed response questions in order to assess students\u2019 ability to research.\u00a0 After the mid-unit assessment, students engage in a structured decision-making process to address the question: \u201cShould the AAP raise its recommended daily screen time from two hours to four hours?\u201d The process guides students to consider the information they gathered while researching, as well as the consequences and impact on stakeholders of each possible position. This leads students to the two-part end of unit assessment. In Part 1, students engage in a Fishbowl discussion about the possible positions they can take (SL.7.1). In Part 2, students formally present their position (SL.7.4, SL.7.5, SL.7.6).",

The mid-unit assessment is the best first draft of the position paper (RI.7.1, W.7.1a, b, e, and W.7.4). In the second half of the unit, students revise their position papers based on teacher feedback. The end of unit assessment is a student reflection on the process of writing the position paper, using evidence from the students\u2019 own work (RI.7.1, W.7.1c, d, W.7.4, W.7.5, and L.7.6). Finally, students engage in the performance task, where they will create a visual representation of their position paper to share with their classmates.",

          "description": "This eight-week module focuses on a \u201cscience and society\u201d topic, engaging students in reading compelling informational text about water sustainability, fresh water management, and how to make evidence-based decisions. In Unit 1, students read the article \u201cWater Is Life\u201d by Barbara Kingsolver as well as excerpts from The Big Thirst by Charles Fishman to build background knowledge about water sustainability and water management. Students determine main ideas and evidence in diverse media and clarify the issue of why humans need to manage water better. They also trace arguments and evaluate the soundness of reasoning and the sufficiency and relevancy of evidence in the texts and media that they engage with in this unit. In Unit 2, students participate in a robust research project in which they investigate the strategies of better agricultural and industrial water management. This research begins with students reading more excerpts from The Big Thirst to scaffold their research skills. Then students conduct internet-based research. To organize their research sources and information, students use a researcher\u2019s notebook. Once they have finished gathering information, students analyze the impact of water management strategies. To help students grapple with this issue, Unit 2 introduces students to a decision-making process called \u201cStakeholder Consequences Decision-Making\u201d (see the end of this document for details). This process will help students understand the implications of various choices, and will scaffold their ability to determine, based on evidence and their own values, what they themselves believe can and should happen. Unit 3 marks the transition from research to writing as students plan and draft a position paper, addressing the question: \u201cWhich category of water management, agricultural or industrial, would be a good place to begin to improve our use of fresh water?\u201d Students have several opportunities for feedback and revision during this unit. As a final performance task, students publish and share a visual representation of their position paper. This task centers on NYSP12 ELA CCLS RI.7.1, W.7.1, W.7.4, W.7.5, and L.7.6.",

              "description": "In this first unit, students are introduced to the concept of water sustainability. To build their background knowledge, they will read two informational texts: \u201cWater Is Life\u201d by Barbara Kingsolver and excerpts of The Big Thirst by Charles Fishman. Alongside a close reading of these texts, students will also practice their ability to listen for main ideas and details in diverse media. This will prepare them for the mid-unit assessment, in which they analyze the main ideas and details in a new video. In the second half of the unit, students will continue to build their knowledge\u00a0of water management and sustainability by shifting their focus to analyzing the argument of informational texts and videos. Students build this skill as they continue to engage with The Big Thirst, as well as supplemental informational texts and videos. The end of unit assessment asks them to analyze and evaluate two arguments: one presented in text and the other presented in a video.",

Students keep a researcher\u2019s notebook in which they document their research findings, generate supporting research questions, and analyze the credibility of their sources as they determine how different authors use evidence to prove their points. In the mid-unit assessment, students engage in a simulated research task focused on water management strategies (RI.7.9, W.7.7, W.7.8, L.7.4c, L.7.4d). The assessment will incorporate selected response and short constructed response questions in order to assess students\u2019 ability to research.\u00a0 After the mid-unit assessment, students engage in a structured decision-making process to address the question: Which category of water management would be a good place to begin to make the way we manage water more sustainable? The process guides students to consider the information they gathered while researching, as well as the consequences and impact on stakeholders of each possible position. This leads students to the two-part end of unit assessment. In Part 1, students engage in a Fishbowl discussion about the possible positions they can take (SL.7.1). In Part 2, students will formally present their position (SL.7.4, SL.7.5, SL.7.6).",

In the first half of the unit, students analyze a model position paper and plan their own. Students have several opportunities to talk through their ideas and get feedback to improve their plans. The mid-unit assessment is the best first draft of the position paper (RI.7.1, W.7.1a, b, e, and W.7.4). In the second half of the unit, students revise their position papers based on teacher feedback. The end of unit assessment is a student reflection on the process of writing the position paper, using evidence from the students\u2019 own work (RI.7.1, W.7.1c, d, W.7.4, W.7.5, and L.7.6). Finally, students engage in the performance task, where they will share a visual representation of their position paper with their classmates.",

          "description": "Overview \tThe Researching to Deepen Understanding units lay out an inquiry process through which students learn how to deepen their understanding of\u00a0topics. Students pose and refine inquiry questions, exploring areas they wish to investigate. They find and\u00a0assess\u00a0sources\u00a0and\u00a0organize\u00a0researched material in ways that will support their analysis and integration of information. As their inquiry\u00a0progresses, they\u00a0evaluate and extend their research, synthesize their information, and eventually express their evolving evidence-based\u00a0perspective. This unit approaches research as an iterative inquiry process for deepening understanding of a topic in order to develop an evidence-based perspective. The unit framework, handouts, and tools are designed to work with any topic across all disciplines. A topic resource repository about water is also provided to help teachers model the process with a rich selection of sources, as well as model tools and inquiry questions.

          "description": "Finding Home: Refugees In this module, students will develop their ability to read and understand complex text as they consider the challenges of fictional and real refugees. In the first unit, students will begin Inside Out & Back Again, by Thanhha Lai, analyzing how critical incidents reveal the dynamic nature of the main character, Ha, a 10-year-old Vietnamese girl whose family is deciding whether to flee during the fall of Saigon. The novel, poignantly told in free verse, will challenge students to consider the impact of specific word choice on tone and meaning. Students will build their ability to infer and analyze text, both in discussion and through writing. They then will read informational text to learn more about the history of war in Vietnam, and the specific historical context of Ha\u2019s family\u2019s struggle during the fall of Saigon. In Unit 2, students will build knowledge about refugees\u2019 search for a place to call home. They will read informational texts that convey universal themes of refugees\u2019 experiences across various times and cultures as they flee and find home. As they continue to move through the novel, they will focus on how particular incidents move the story forward and reveal aspects of Ha\u2019s character. Unit 2 culminates in which students examine how the universal refugee experience causes the refugee\u2019s life to be turned inside out and eventually return back again. In Unit 3, having finished the novel, students will reread critical incidents, while also working in research groups to study the experiences of refugees from one of several cultures. Students will use this knowledge to write to write two, free verse narrative poems that capture the universal refugee experience. Students will reread poems from the novel as mentor texts. These free-verse narrative poems performance task centers on NYSP12 ELA Standards RI.8.1, RI.8.2, W.8.3, W.8.4, W.8.5, W.8.7, W.8.9, L.8.1, and L.8.2.",

They will read informational texts that convey the universal themes and experiences of refugees across various times and cultures. This study will draw students\u2019 attention to the challenges refugees face when they are fleeing and finding home. As students continue to move through the novel, they will focus on how particular incidents move the story forward and reveal aspects of Ha\u2019s character. Ha will be analyzed as a case study of a refugee who is faced with challenges that represent the universal refugee themes of fleeing and finding home. For their mid-unit assessment, students will read an informational text and analyze one refugee\u2019s experience of finding home. Unit 2 culminates in a formal literary analysis essay in which students will explain the significance of the novel\u2019s title and how it relates to the universal refugee experience and the challenges Ha faces as a refugee.",

              "description": "In Unit 3, students will draw upon their study of the universal refugee experience to write two research-based poems that reflect the \u201cinside out\u201d and \u201cback again\u201d aspect of a refugee experience. Students will collaborate in research teams to research the experiences of refugees of a specific culture. They then will draw upon the research and their study of the novel and the informational texts to write two poems. Students will gather the strongest evidence from informational texts in order to answer specific Who? Where? and Why? questions, and these answers will then be used to write an \u201cinside out\u201d poem, which is about a fictional character who experienced real events students learned about in their research. This \u201cinside out\u201d poem will establish the time, place, and reason for fleeing home. As students prepare to write this poem, they will return to the novel to study a poem for its craft and structure as well as word choice and figurative language. Students\u2019 writing of the poem will also be supported through the use of a poem graphic organizer. The mid-unit assessment is students\u2019 best first draft of this poem. Students then draft their \u201cback again\u201d poem, aligned with the students\u2019 individual interpretation of informational text and their own background knowledge and experiences. They receive peer critique on both poems to ensure they are setting their poem in a particular scene to give the details and information they are including an appropriate context. Students then write a best draft of their two revised poems and present them to peers from other research teams. This serves as the final performance task, which centers on NYSP12 CCSS RI.8.1, RI.8.2, W.8.3a, b, d, W.8.4, W.8.5, W.8.7, W.8.9, W.11b, L.8.1, L.8.2, and L.8.6.",

          "description": "Working With Evidence: Taking a Stand In this second module, students will continue to develop their ability to closely read text while studying the theme of taking a stand. During the first half of Unit 1, students will read two speeches reflecting examples of real people taking a stand. By reading these speeches they will build background knowledge about the module\u2019s overarching theme, engage in a study of the speaker\u2019s perspective, and analyze the craft of forming an argument. In the second half of Unit 1, students will read Part 1 of To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee and continue to study the theme of taking a stand as it is revealed in the novel. Students will engage in a character study of Atticus by analyzing his actions and words, and what others say about him, to better understand him as a character. This analysis will provide details and evidence for students to use in their end of Unit 2 argument essay. In addition to reading and studying the text, students will view excerpts of the To Kill a Mockingbird film that strongly convey the novel\u2019s themes, and they will analyze how the film remains true to the original text as well as how it veers from the original. In Unit 2, students will continue to study the theme of taking a stand as they finish the novel. They will develop their argument writing skills through scaffolded writing lessons, culminating in a literary analysis essay in which they argue whether or not it made sense, based on Atticus\u2019s character, for him to have taken a stand and defend Tom Robinson. In Unit 3, having finished the novel, students will return to key quotes from the novel that relate to the themes of the Golden Rule and Taking a Stand. Students will form groups to create a Readers Theater montage in which they select one key quote; then they will select scenes from the novel that reveal the message of the quote. Students will recreate these scenes in a Readers Theater structure and provide commentary on how their script remains true and veers from the original text. This Readers Theater final performance task centers on NYSP12 ELA Standards RL.8.2, RL.8.3, W.8.3, W.8.4, and W.8.11b.",

These speeches include Shirley Chisholm\u2019s \u201cEqual Rights for Women\u201d and Sojourner Truth\u2019s \u201cAin\u2019t I a Woman?\u201d For both speeches, students will analyze the central idea and supporting details, how the structure contributes to the meaning and style, the speaker\u2019s claims and supporting evidence, and how the speaker addresses counterclaims. The\u00a0mid-unit assessment centers on excerpts from Lyndon Johnson\u2019s \u201cThe Great Society\u201d speech, and addresses NYS CCLS RI.8.2, RI.8.5, and RI.8.6.Following the mid-unit assessment, students will begin reading the module\u2019s central text, To Kill a Mockingbird, by Harper Lee. The novel is launched with a highly scaffolded reading of the first chapter and building several strong reading routines (including taking structured notes and an explicit focus on vocabulary work) that will support students in successfully reading this rich text across both Units 1 and 2. As students read Part 1 of the novel, they will gather text evidence related to the theme of taking a stand. They also will consider how the author draws upon the Golden Rule and renders it new. They will analyze several poems related to the Golden Rule, comparing and contrasting the structure of each poem and the narrative arc of chapters of the novel, analyzing how the differing structure of each text contributes to its meaning and style. Finally, students will examine allusions to other texts within the novel. In the end of unit assessment, students will demonstrate their understanding of the Golden Rule theme, allusions to other texts, and how text structure develops meaning.",

                  "description": "The text-dependent questions in this lesson are based heavily on the Making Evidence-Based Claims units developed by Odell Education. For the original Odell Education units, go to www.odelleducation.com/resources. \t\u2022 World Caf\u00e9 is a protocol that promotes discussion and leadership in students. The first round and the first transition need very clear direction. After that, students tend to pick up the protocol quickly. \t\u2022 For the purposes of this lesson, the World Caf\u00e9 protocol is modified to give students time to think on their own before talking to their group. \t\u2022 Consider posting the steps for World Caf\u00e9 on the board or chart paper where students can see them. \t\u2022 The goal of this lesson is to give students another opportunity to practice the skills that will be assessed on the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment in the next lesson. \t\u2022 Previously, students have used the Summary Writing graphic organizer to prepare their ideas to write summaries. In this module, summary writing will be much less scaffolded. This lesson marks a transition, so instead of the Summary Writing\u00a0graphic organizer, students are asked to consider the same things but without the graphic support. Keep in mind that students who struggle may still benefit from using the organizer. On the mid-unit assessment, students will not be presented with any\u00a0scaffolding for summary writing. Consider, however, continuing to provide the graphic organizer for students who may need extra support. Refer to Lesson 4. \t\u2022 In advance: To make it easier to form groups for the World Caf\u00e9, consider putting sticky notes under students\u2019 chairs with numbers on them. When it is time to form the groups, ask students to find the sticky note under their chair and sit with others\u00a0who have the same number to form their first group.",

                  "description": "This lesson launches students\u2019 study of To Kill a Mockingbird. Students first encounter the novel through Story Impressions, a pre-reading activity in which students make predictions about a piece of literature through reading phrases from the novel or connected to the novel and then developing an \u201cimpression\u201d of the text. The phrases included for this activity will familiarize\u00a0students with setting and characters. \t\u2022 To Kill a Mockingbird is a difficult text. In this lesson, students hear the first chapter read aloud as they follow along silently. This read-aloud gives students a chance to hear a fluent reader model this difficult text. In previous lessons, the read-aloud was\u00a0\u201cpure\u201d and was read only to model fluency and help build understanding. For this read-aloud, continue to model fluent reading but also pause for comprehension checks to ensure students\u2019 understanding as they begin this complex text. \t\u2022 This lesson introduces students to a new structured notes routine that they will use throughout their study of the novel. Students used Structured Notes graphic organizers during Module 1 (while reading Inside Out & Back Again). But because the\u00a0demands of To Kill a Mockingbird are different, the \u201cstructure\u201d of the structured notes is also different here in Module 2A. With each reading assignment, students write the gist of the reading homework, answer a focus question, and attend to teacher selected\u00a0vocabulary words. Key words for each chapter include academic words that serve a number of purposes. Most have prefixes, suffixes, or Latin and Greek roots. Many are adjectives that are used to describe setting or characters. Others are words \tstudents should know to understand critical incidents in the novel. \t\u2022 For readers who struggle, an optional set of supported structured notes is provided that includes chapter summaries and vocabulary definitions. Those summaries were retrieved from\u00a0http://kindledminds.wikispaces.com/file/detail/To+Kill+a+Mockingbird+Cha....",

The Gallery Walk introduction of this theme incorporates a wide variety of worldviews, philosophies, and religions. \t\u2022 Students also view a short segment of the film version of To Kill a Mockingbird. Viewing film clips serves two purposes. First, it helps struggling readers make sense of this complex text. The interplay of reading, rereading, and viewing is an engaging way\u00a0to present this material. (Note: Do not play the entire film for students. Strategically designed lessons incorporate film at critical junctures in student learning.) For this first purpose, the film is a supplement; working with the text is the goal. The second purpose for using the film clips is to directly address RL.7.9. Students compare the film version of certain scenes to the novel. Students begin to use the new Text to Film Comparison note-catcher. Note that Work Time Part B includes time to ensure that students understand two phrases that are crucial academic vocabulary related to RL.8.9: \u201cstays faithful to\u201d and \u201cdeparts from.\u201d Continue to reinforce these phrases across the unit. Note also that RL.8.9 requires students not only to notice similarities and \tdifferences, but specifically to evaluate the effectiveness of the changes made by the director and actors.",

This activity gives students an opportunity to explore further how To Kill a Mockingbird makes connections to a\u00a0theme from religious works throughout the world. \t\u2022 Students also will learn a new protocol, Networking Sessions, for discussing text. This protocol is similar to Think-Pair-Share, but it allows for movement and a chance to hear from a variety of partners. \t\u2022 The closing of this lesson is an opportunity for students to add to their Atticus note-catchers.

However, in this lesson, the analysis does not go as in-depth with questions pertaining to word choice or perspective, since this text is more accessible. Remind students that even though they are focused on structure, they need to keep in mind those other elements of poetry in order to understand the meaning. In Lesson 17, students will come back to this\u00a0poem and compare it to the novel. \t\u2022 Note that the poem \u201cIncident\u201d directly refers to a moment when the Golden Rule is not followed, and it involves a racial slur. Be sure to read the poem in advance and be prepared to handle this offensive slur sensitively with students. \t\u2022 During Work Time, the reading focus in this lesson is first for students to analyze a quote that shows Scout\u2019s perspective about Boo Radley. These quotes are pulled from several chapters, not just Chapter 8. The purpose is for students to participate in a jigsaw in order to understand how Scout\u2019s perspective about Boo Radley changes over the course of the book. The focus on Boo is built into this lesson because the incident when Boo puts the blanket on Scout\u2019s shoulders is a turning point in the way Scout thinks of Boo.",

The goal is for students to understand more fully why Atticus would take a stand for Tom Robinson. Understanding Atticus is key to writing the argument essay for the End of Unit 2\u00a0Assessment. \t\u2022 To analyze Chapter 10, students will engage in a World Caf\u00e9 protocol, introduced for the first time in Module 2, Unit 1, Lesson 6. Time is built into this lesson for students to prepare for the World Caf\u00e9 before they begin their discussion. The purpose of\u00a0that is to make sure every student is ready to contribute to the conversation. It is fine if students have not had enough time to fully complete their notes before the World Caf\u00e9; the preparation period is meant simply to give them individual processing time\u00a0in order to elevate the level of conversation during the World Caf\u00e9.",

As they read, students will continue to reflect on the reading by answering focus questions that attend to the theme of taking a stand, while also studying other important aspects of the novel involving character analysis and perspective. In order to track their thinking as they read the rest of the novel, students will continue to add to their Atticus Note-catchers from Unit 1 as well as the Taking a Stand anchor chart. For the mid-unit assessment, students will summarize a key scene in the novel, view the\u00a0film excerpt of that scene, then compare and contrast the film version and the novel to determine how the film version remains the same or veers from the original text. Students will also consider the choices made by the actors and the director in their text-to-film analysis. After the mid-unit assessment, students continue to read the novel and begin to prepare for the argument essay by examining a model essay and writing rubric. For their end of unit assessment, students write an argument essay in which they argue whether it makes sense for Atticus, based on his character, to take a stand to defend Tom Robinson.",

By doing this,\u00a0students will synthesize and refer to the racial prejudice and tension that this trial represents. This is a crucial aspect of the novel that comes to the forefront in Part 2. \t\u2022 Students will also relate Chapters 20 and 21 to taking a stand as they continue to study this theme across various scenes, individuals, and groups of people in the novel. \t\u2022 In this lesson, students will work with their Discussion Appointment partner to analyze the key quote. As pairs complete each question on the note-catcher, one at a time, they will debrief with the whole class. Use the Atticus\u2019s Closing Speech note-catcher\u00a0(for teacher reference) to guide and support student thinking. For the purposes of the whole group sharing, designate each student in a Discussion Appointment partnership as either A or B to provide the opportunity for total participation.",

                  "description": "In this lesson, students begin the writing process for the End of Unit 2 Assessment, an argument essay on To Kill a Mockingbird. \tIn the design of this lesson and the lessons that follow, the following criteria were used to define argument writing: \t* The goal of argument writing is for the reader to acknowledge the validity of the claim (not necessarily be persuaded by it). \t* Appropriate evidence is used and analyzed logically to support the claim. This evidence is usually organized into reasons. \t* The author considers the reasons and evidence for the reasons before articulating the claim. \t* The author acknowledges and responds to a counterclaim in his or her writing. \t\u2022 Lessons 9\u201311 focus on the thinking that students need to do before crafting their own argument essay. It is important to take\u00a0this time because argument thinking and writing is hard\u2014in a sense, the writer is trying to work with a complicated question\u00a0that often has many aspects to consider. First, writers know the issue well, then carefully consider all the relevant ideas before\u00a0coming up with a good claim. Once they\u2019ve come up with that claim, they acknowledge other ways of thinking about it so that\u00a0the reader can grasp the full depth of the good thinking the writer is doing. \t\u2022 The argument essay in this module focuses on crafting a clear, logical argument. This is a writing skill that will be developed\u00a0further in Module 4 when students will be asked to take this skill one step further as they study argument writing in greater depth. \t\u2022 The model essay is about the decision that Mrs. Dubose makes to overcome her morphine addiction before she dies. The\u00a0model essay is intentionally written about the same text (To Kill a Mockingbird) that students also will write about, so that\u00a0students are familiar with the context. However, the model essay does not use exactly the same examples and information that\u00a0the student essay will use. \t\u2022 Students will need the model essay in subsequent lessons, so ask them to keep their copy. \t\u2022 The writing process for the argument essay is similar to that of Module 1. The rubric for this assignment is based closely on the NY State Grades 6\u20138 Expository Writing Evaluation Rubric. Because students are already familiar with that rubric, the rubric analysis built into these lessons will not be as in-depth as it was in Module 1. \t\u2022 Remember, writing is really about thinking. To be successful with a writing assignment, students need to know the content well and understand the structure in which they will work. Students have been developing a clear understanding of content; today is the day they build their understanding of what an argument essay is. \t\u2022 There is space on the Supporting Evidence-Based Claims graphic organizer for three pieces of evidence per paragraph, but there are only two pieces of evidence per paragraph in the model essay. This is intentionally done in order to allow flexibility in the writing of the essays. It also shows students that the quantity of evidence is not the only thing to consider when supporting an argument\u2014it is more important to have the best possible evidence.",

Today, students use their Atticus note-catchers and their understanding of Atticus as a character to weigh the evidence and craft the claim for their argument essay. \t\u2022 The prompt for the argument essay is set up to guide students toward the same position: It does make sense for Atticus to defend Tom Robinson. An answer to the contrary may show a lack of comprehension of Atticus as a character or of how best to use evidence. The goal of this essay is to teach students the basic skills involved in writing an argument essay. Students will have another opportunity to craft an argument in Module 4, and will be able to choose among several valid claims to support. \t\u2022 This lesson is a decision point for the students. By the end of the lesson, each student will write the claim in her essay and the underlying reasons. To help students decide which claim to argue, they will text code the Atticus note-catchers and weigh the evidence that they have gathered as they read To Kill a Mockingbird. \t\u2022 This lesson opens with a short discussion of Chapter 28. Although this isn\u2019t a reading lesson, this entry task will encourage students to continue with the reading homework.",

This is a way to help students understand that when they use \tevidence in an argument essay, they should always: \t\u2022 * Analyze the quote. This is where students show their thinking about how the quote develops the reasons and claim. This part is often where students struggle the most. To support them, there is language included in the Quote Sandwich guide, such as\u00a0\u201cthis shows.\u201d Since students are learning this skill, the language used is meant to be easy for students to imitate. When they have mastered the analysis (the thinking in the writing), then they can begin to use more sophisticated transitions (the craft in the writing). \t\u2022 This lesson includes peer critique. Critiques simulate the experiences students will have in the workplace and thus help build a culture of achievement, collaboration, and open-mindedness in your classroom. Students engaged in a different peer critique structure in Module 1 when the provided Stars and Steps for the \u201cInside Out\u201d poems. \t\u2022 This peer critique protocol is similar to the Praise-Question-Suggest protocol (see Appendix 1). That is done intentionally to build student capacity. \t\u2022 In advance: Consider creating a peer critique packet for each student that includes the Quote Sandwich guide, Quote Sandwich for Peer Critique, Peer Critique Expectations and Directions, and Peer Critique recording form in order to make distributing\u00a0papers more efficient. \t\u2022 Students are introduced to the Essay Planner at the end of this lesson. Each space for planning the body paragraphs features room for three quote sandwiches, which reflects the space provided on the Supporting Evidence-Based Claims graphic organizer. You may wish to remind students that they may have two quote sandwiches instead of three in their body paragraphs since they should select the strongest evidence to support their reason.",

If rubrics from Module 1 are not available, pass out blank New York State Expository Writing Evaluation\u00a0Rubrics and ask students to recall as best they can. \t\u2022 During Work Time Part B, consider working with students who still need help understanding what an argument essay is or how to write a claim with reasons and evidence for an argument essay. \t\u2022 In advance: Make sure students have access to their essay rubrics from Module 1. If the completed rubric is not accessible,\u00a0provide a blank version of the rubric used in Module 1. \t\u2022 Review exit tickets from Lesson 10 to make sure all students are starting with appropriate claims and reasons. \t\u2022 Prepare the following passage from the model essay to post, either on board, chart paper, or with the document camera. \t\u2022 When Jem and Scout walk by her house, Mrs. Dubose would not let any small transgression go by without commenting on it. For instance, Scout says, \u201cIf I said as sunnily as I could, \u2018Hey, Mrs. Dubose,\u2019 I would receive for an answer, \u2018Don\u2019t you say hey to me you ugly girl! You say good afternoon, Mrs. Dubose!\u2019\u201d (99) This shows that Mrs. Dubose holds high expectations of others, even if they make a small mistake.",

                  "description": "In this lesson, students write the draft of their essay about Atticus\u2019s decision to defend Tom Robinson. In the previous four\u00a0lessons, students have shaped their arguments, planned their essays, and critiqued one another\u2019s work. At this point, students\u00a0need time to craft their essay. \t\u2022 This lesson is written assuming students will use computers to draft the essays in order to make later revisions easier. \t\u2022 Consider the setup of your classroom if you are using laptops; since students can distract themselves on computers, think about positioning the desks so that it is easy to scan the screens throughout the lesson. \t\u2022 If your students are not familiar with expectations about computer use in the classroom, explain them at the beginning of work time. \t\u2022 Be sure to think about how students will submit their drafts at the end of class: printing, saving to a server, emailing, etc. \t\u2022 If using computers is not possible in your classroom, consider giving students more time to handwrite their essays. \t\u2022 Since students will produce this essay draft independently, it is used as an assessment for \u201cClaim and Reasons\u201d and \u201cCommand of Evidence\u201d on the argument rubric. Return the essay drafts with feedback in Lesson 16. Be sure to give feedback on the\u00a0\u201cCoherence, Style, and Organization\u201d row and the \u201cCommand of Conventions\u201d row of the rubric so that students can make those revisions in Lesson 16. \t\u2022 A sample student argument essay is included for teacher reference in the supporting materials of this lesson. While it is not needed during the lesson itself, it may be useful to have a sample student response for assessment purposes. \t\u2022 See teaching note at the end of this lesson regarding the possibility of launching independent reading at this point in Module 2, in order to have more time to read and give feedback on students\u2019 draft essays.",

If not, you may need to give them the criteria (in the body of the lesson, during Work Time A). \t\u2022 In this lesson, students are put into groups for Readers Theater, and one of the key quotes from Lesson 8 is allocated to each group. Students then work in their groups to give each group member a different scene from the anchor chart for which he\u00a0or she will write a Readers Theater script. It is important that each individual works on a different scene; otherwise, there will be multiple versions of the same scene in the final Readers Theater, which will be confusing. Groups may need assistance\u00a0allocating scenes to individuals. \t\u2022 In advance: Organize students into groups of three or four and assign each group a key quote.

For the mid-unit assessment, students will write a short commentary that explains how the passage\u00a0develops the main idea of the anchor quote. For the end of unit assessment, students will write a commentary on how their script is a response to To Kill a Mockingbird and how it connects to and diverges from the novel. The final performance task will be a presentation of the Readers Theater script by the small group.

          "description": "In this second module, students read and analyze Shakespeare\u2019s A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream. As with any of Shakespeare\u2019s play, many rich themes are present; in this module, students will focus primarily on the theme of control. Characters in this play are controlled by emotions, other characters, and even magic. They often attempt to manipulate others in a variety of ways. Students will examine why the characters seek control, how they try to control others, and the results of attempting to control others. In Unit 1, students will build background knowledge as they explore the appeal and authorship of Shakespeare. Students will read much of the play aloud in a Drama Circle, and will frequently reread key passages to deepen their understanding. Students will analyze differences between a film version of the play and Shakespeare\u2019s original script. In Unit 2, students will study how Shakespeare drew upon Greek mythology as he crafted the play within the play. They will continue to closely study characters who attempt to control or manipulate others in the play, and write an argument essay about whether or not Shakespeare makes the case in A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream that it is possible to control someone else\u2019s actions or not. In Unit 3, students will write a \u201cconfessional\u201d narrative from the point of view of one of the characters in A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream to creatively explain his or her attempts to control or manipulate someone else in the play. This performance task centers on standards NYSP12 ELA CCLS RL.8.2, RL.8.3, W.8.3, W.8.4, W.8.9a, and W.11b.",

Students also read along as the teacher reads aloud a text that further develops their background knowledge about Shakespeare. This read-aloud gives students a chance to hear a fluent reader model difficult text. This is a \u201cpure\u201d read-aloud, with no interruptions. Read to model fluency and help build understanding. Students then consider the advantages and disadvantages of learning about Shakespeare from images and text. This is a two-part lesson. Students will return to the topic of the universal appeal of Shakespeare in Lesson 7. Hold on to the Gallery Walk images to use again in that lesson.",

They will consider the causes of both Japanese and American involvement in the war, beginning with the attack on Pearl Harbor. Students will read FDR\u2019s and the Japanese government\u2019s responses to the bombing and will consider conflicting perspectives of the same event. For the mid-unit assessment, they will collect, prepare, and submit their best evidence revealing conflicting accounts and perspectives on the attack on Pearl Harbor. Students will\u00a0use this evidence for the end of unit assessment in which they will present the information in a Fishbowl discussion. During this unit, they will begin reading the central text of the module, Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption by Laura Hillenbrand. As they read Part 1 of the text in this unit, students will build background knowledge on American Louis Zamperini, as well as begin their study of Hillenbrand\u2019s craft as she weaves a compelling narrative in this piece of literary nonfiction.",

              "description": "In this second unit, students will continue to closely examine the case study of imprisoned Louie Zamperini as they read Unbroken. They will expand their study as they learn about interned Japanese-American Min\u00e9 Okubo in a separate biographical account. As students read both Zamperini\u2019s and Okubo\u2019s stories, they will focus on the theme of resisting forced \u201cinvisibility\u201d while being imprisoned or interned. This theme concept will be analyzed through a dual lens: the internal struggle to maintain dignity, identity, and self-worth against dehumanizing efforts; and the external isolation of being closed off from the outside world while in captivity. In the mid-unit assessment, students will build on the background knowledge they have gained about the Pacific Theater in World War II and the plight of Japanese-Americas as they classify various mediums used to convey information about World War II. Students will also evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of using different mediums to communicate during this mid-unit assessment. For the end of unit assessment, students will write an informational essay in which they use the strongest evidence from both texts to show how captors forced \u201cinvisibility\u201d upon those imprisoned or interned.",

Students will briefly research Min\u00e9 Okubo\u2019s life after internment and then write a narrative in which they tell the story of Okubo\u2019s journey from \u201cinvisible\u201d during internment to becoming \u201cvisible\u201d post-internment. For the mid-unit assessment, students will submit their single-draft narrative. For the end of unit assessment, students will complete a narrative techniques assessment in which they determine the effectiveness of various language techniques. Finally, for the final performance task, students will share their narrative with a small group of students and reflect upon their research-based narrative writing piece.",

          "description": "In this module, students analyze arguments and the evidence used to support arguments to determine whether sufficient evidence has been used and whether the evidence is relevant in support of the claim an author or speaker is making. They then research to gather evidence to make their own spoken and written arguments. Students will read Michael Pollan\u2019s The Omnivore\u2019s Dilemma (930L), a literary non-fiction text about where food comes from and about making decisions about what food to buy and eat. They build background knowledge about what happens to food before it gets to the consumer, and the different choices the consumer can make when buying food while analyzing Michael Pollan\u2019s arguments and the evidence he uses to support his claims. In Unit 2, students engage in a robust research project in which they further investigate the consequences of each of the food chains and the stakeholders affected in those food chains. To help students grapple with this issue, they use a decision-making process called \u201cStakeholder Consequences Decision-Making\u201d (see the end of this document for details). This process will help students understand the implications of various choices, and will scaffold their ability to determine, based on evidence and their own values, to take a position on which food chain they would choose if they were trying to feed everyone in the US. Students finish the module by writing a position paper explaining which of Michael Pollan\u2019s food chain they would choose to feed the US and why, and creating a poster stating their position. This task addresses NYSP12 ELA Standards RI.8.1,W.8.1, W.8.1a, W.8.1b, W.8.1c, W.8.1d, W.8.1e and W.8.9.",

Students begin reading the Young Readers Edition of Michael Pollan\u2019s The Omnivore\u2019s Dilemma (930L), a high-interest literary nonfiction text about where food comes from and how it gets to our plate. As they read the text, they are involved in a study of the author\u2019s purpose and how to determine what that\u00a0is. At the same time, they analyze videos of speeches and interviews on the same topic of food and how it gets to our plate in order to analyze a speaker\u2019s purpose. In the second half of the unit, students move on to analyze authors\u2019 and speakers\u2019 claims and whether they use relevant and sufficient evidence and sound reasoning to support their claims. They also read and listen for the use of irrelevant evidence.",

They make a decision to answer this question by researching the consequences and stakeholders of each food chain. Students use The Omnivore\u2019s Dilemma as a starting point to identify the consequences of each of the food chains. They work in research teams to create a Cascading Consequences chart for each\u00a0food chain that begins with consequences listed in the text; then they expand their research and consequences by searching for appropriate articles and resources through a child-safe search engine. Teams then use their cascading consequences to identify the stakeholders who will be affected by the consequences, and from there determine which food chain they would choose to feed the United States. At the end of the unit, students present a position speech answering the question.",

The paper must include a claim to answer the question, two reasons for making that claim, and evidence to support\u00a0each of the reasons. There must also be a counterclaim and response. Students analyze a model position paper to guide them in the writing process and plan their essay one paragraph at a time. For the performance task at the end of the unit, students create a visual representation of their position paper.",

Students pose and refine inquiry questions, exploring areas they wish to investigate. They find and\u00a0assess\u00a0sources\u00a0and\u00a0organize\u00a0researched material in ways that will support their analysis and integration of information. As their inquiry\u00a0progresses, they\u00a0evaluate and extend their research, synthesize their information, and eventually express their evolving evidence-based\u00a0perspective. This unit approaches research as an iterative inquiry process for deepening understanding of a topic in order to develop an evidence-based perspective. The unit framework, handouts, and tools are designed to work with any topic across all disciplines. A topic resource repository about human-animal interaction is also provided to help teachers model the process with a rich selection of sources, as well as model tools and inquiry questions.

Students will prepare for and complete an assessment of standards RI.9-10.1 and RI.9-10.4 using the Rilke text. For homework, students identified three powerful language choices that Rilke employs to shape the central ideas of his text. In this lesson, they will use their collected evidence to complete a formal writing assignment as their Mid-Unit Assessment. This assignment asks students to describe how Rilke uses language in Letter One to build and express his central advice. This assessment requires students to marshal multiple pieces of evidence to explain an idea, assessing their capacity both to use evidence to support analysis and to trace the development of an idea across an entire text.",

Your houses!\u201d). In this excerpt, a fight breaks out between Mercutio and Tybalt after Tybalt insults Romeo, and Mercutio is killed. Students work in pairs to explore how Shakespeare develops Romeo\u2019s character through his interactions with Tybalt and Mercutio. Prior to reading, students view a clip of Baz Luhrmann\u2019s Romeo + Juliet, depicting the marriage of Romeo and Juliet. Student learning is assessed via a Quick Write at the end of the lesson: How does Shakespeare develop Romeo\u2019s character through his interactions with Tybalt and Mercutio? For homework, students continue their Accountable Independent Reading (AIR) and write a brief response to the question: \u201cWho is responsible for Mercutio\u2019s death?\u201d",

The next lesson will focus on a close reading of lines 89\u2013126 and guide students to develop their understanding of the Friar\u2019s plan.

The questions also ask students to consider specific lines from the poem that begin to address central idea and Dickinson\u2019s structural choices, concepts upon which Lessons 10 and 11 will continue to build.The assessment for Lesson 9, a Quick Write, asks students to consider the cumulative impact of five specific lines from the poem\u2014one from each stanza\u2014on the meaning of the poem.",

Through a series of guided questions, students will make meaning of Dickinson\u2019s extended metaphor, of the funeral service (and burial), and consider the speaker\u2019s experience as he/she grapples with a deteriorating mental state and isolation. Students will complete this lesson with a Quick Write that prompts them to consider an emerging central idea of madness. \"",

Students will first participate in a fishbowl discussion about their areas of investigation, dialoguing with their peers about the pre-search and its effect on their understanding of an area of investigation. Students will then engage in a short discussion in pairs or small groups about a central idea in the Grandin text and how it is developed and refined over the course of the chapter. For assessment, students will then individually create an evidence-based claim about the development and refinement of a central idea in the chapter.",

Students pose and refine inquiry questions, exploring areas they wish to investigate. They find and\u00a0assess\u00a0sources\u00a0and\u00a0organize\u00a0researched material in ways that will support their analysis and integration of information. As their inquiry\u00a0progresses, they\u00a0evaluate and extend their research, synthesize their information, and eventually express their evolving evidence-based\u00a0perspective. This unit approaches research as an iterative inquiry process for deepening understanding of a topic in order to develop an evidence-based perspective. The unit framework, handouts, and tools are designed to work with any topic across all disciplines. Two topic resource repositories are also provided\u2013one about music and the other about technology\u2013to help teachers model the process with a rich selection of sources, as well as model tools and inquiry questions.

The texts in this module represent varied voices, experiences, and perspectives, but are united by their shared exploration of the effects of prejudice and oppression on identity construction. Each of the module texts is a complex work with multiple central ideas and claims that complement the central ideas and claims of other texts in the module. All four module texts offer rich opportunities to analyze authorial engagement with past and present struggles against oppression, as well as how an author\u2019s rhetoric or word choices strengthen the power and persuasiveness of the text.",

              "description": "In the first unit of Module 11.2, students analyze two seminal texts about African Americans in post-Emancipation America. Students begin this unit by reading \"Of Our Spiritual Strivings,\" the first chapter of W.E.B. Du Bois\u2019s The Souls of Black Folk. Student analysis focuses on how Du Bois develops his point of view that African Americans must obtain the full civil rights of \"culture, work, and liberty\" in order to achieve social equality. Next, students analyze Booker T. Washington\u2019s \"Atlanta Compromise Speech,\" considering how Washington develops his point of view that economic security is more important than social integration in improving the conditions of African Americans and their relations with white Southerners. Read together, these texts form a compelling conversation, in which each author presents a nuanced argument for the crucial role of African Americans in post-Emancipation America. Throughout this unit, students continue to build skills for reading closely as they analyze how central ideas emerge and develop, and determine how each author uses rhetoric to advance his point of view and purpose. Students practice and build upon their informative/explanatory writing skills through written assessments. Additionally, students develop their ability to analyze an author\u2019s argument, and articulate and support their ideas using textual evidence. This work prepares students to evaluate these two texts in relation to each other at the end of this unit, as they consider the approaches both authors take in using rhetoric to advance their points of view. There are two formal assessments in this unit. In the Mid-Unit-Assessment, students write a multi-paragraph response analyzing how Du Bois uses rhetoric or figurative language to develop a central idea in \"Of Our Spiritual Strivings.\" For the End-of-Unit Assessment, students write a multi-paragraph",

Students will return to this epigraph in Lesson 16, as they draw upon their understanding of the text in its entirety to build upon their initial analysis. After listening to a masterful reading of the chapter, students analyze the first paragraph of \"Of Our Spiritual Strivings\" (from \"Between me and the other world there is ever an unasked question\" to \"I answer seldom a word\"). In this passage, Du Bois describes the \"unasked question\" that lies between him and \"others\" (par. 1).",

Du Bois (from \"So dawned the time of Sturm and Drang\" to \"or her vulgar music with the soul of the Sorrow Songs?\"). In this paragraph, Du Bois further develops the central idea of attaining liberty as he reflects upon the \"ideals of the past\" (par. 12) and considers what is necessary for the future. In this lesson, students explore the development of central ideas over the course of the text. Student learning is assessed via a Quick Write at the end of the lesson: How do two or more central ideas from \"Of Our Spiritual Strivings\" interact and build on one another in this excerpt?",

Students engage in a collaborative discussion about Du Bois\u2019s purpose for writing the chapter and how he refines a central idea in the final two paragraphs. Additionally, students revise a Quick Write assessment from a previous lesson, integrating writing skills learned in previous lessons. For the lesson assessment, students revise their Quick Write responses from either Lesson 13 or Lesson 14, based on the following prompt: Expand and develop your Quick Write response from either Lesson 13 or 14 by refining your evidence selection or adding more significant and relevant evidence, and incorporate appropriate and varied transitions to link ideas and create cohesion.",

After analyzing the poem, students revisit the text as a whole and work in groups to analyze how Du Bois uses figurative language or rhetoric to develop a central idea in the text. Student learning is assessed via the Mid-Unit Assessment Evidence Collection Tool at the end of the lesson.

Next, students read Audre Lorde\u2019s contemporary poem, \"From the House of Yemanj\u00e1.\" Lorde\u2019s exploration of how a daughter\u2019s sense of self is influenced by her complex relationship with her mother provides an alternate voice and perspective on the experience of being a woman in America. Throughout this unit, students continue to practice their informative/explanatory writing skills while developing their ability to analyze an author\u2019s use of rhetoric and figurative language. Students determine an author\u2019s point of view or purpose, and analyze how style and content contribute to the power, persuasiveness, or beauty of the text. Additionally, students analyze specific word choice and figurative language to determine its role in both texts. In addition to reading and writing, students initiate and participate in a range of collaborative discussions, using textual evidence to support their analysis. There is one formal assessment in this unit. For the End-of-Unit Assessment, students write a multi-paragraph response in which they consider a central idea from Lorde\u2019s poem or \"An Address by Elizabeth Cady Stanton,\" and identify a similar or related idea in one other text from the module. Students compare the approaches that the two authors of their choice take in developing a similar or related central idea, considering how each author uses either word choice, rhetoric, point of view, or purpose to develop this idea.",

Building on work with evidence-based analysis in Modules 11.1 and 12.2, students explore topics that have multiple positions and perspectives by gathering and analyzing research based on vetted sources to establish a position of their own. Students first generate a written evidence-based perspective, which will serve as the early foundation of what will ultimately become a written research-based argument paper. The research-based argument paper synthesizes and articulates several claims using valid reasoning and relevant and sufficient evidence to support the claims. Students read and analyze sources to surface potential problem-based questions for research, and develop and strengthen their writing by revising and editing.",

Students pose and refine inquiry questions, exploring areas they wish to investigate. They find and\u00a0assess\u00a0sources\u00a0and\u00a0organize\u00a0researched material in ways that will support their analysis and integration of information. As their inquiry\u00a0progresses, they\u00a0evaluate and extend their research, synthesize their information, and eventually express their evolving evidence-based\u00a0perspective. This unit approaches research as an iterative inquiry process for deepening understanding of a topic in order to develop an evidence-based perspective. The unit framework, handouts, and tools are designed to work with any topic across all disciplines. Two topic resource repositories are also provided\u2013one about food and the other about design\u2013to help teachers model the process with a rich selection of sources, as well as model tools and inquiry questions.

Next, students analyze the complex ideas and language in Henry David Thoreau\u2019s essay, \u201cCivil Disobedience.\u201d In 12.2.2, students read William Shakespeare\u2019s The Tragedy of Julius Caesar in its entirety.

Module 12.3 fosters students\u2019 independent learning by decreasing scaffolds in key research lessons as students gather and analyze research based on vetted sources to establish a position of their own.

Students identify and trace the development of central ideas and motifs in Morrison\u2019s complex narrative of a young African-American man\u2019s journey towards independence and acceptance, engaging with the interrelated concepts of identity, community, love, mercy, freedom, flight, naming, storytelling, and the supernatural. This module is structured around a gradual release of responsibility to students for their learning, which fosters students\u2019 independent thinking and writing capacities. As the module progresses, scaffolds in key text analysis lessons are strategically removed. Song of Solomon, which is already used in some high school classrooms, includes some mature themes and may use some language that is outside of a student\u2019s particular cultural experience. As with any curriculum module or text, the NYSED\u00a0encourages a local school district review prior to using in the classroom.",
