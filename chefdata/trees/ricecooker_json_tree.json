The student materials consist of the student pages for each lesson in Module 5.\u00a0\u00a0 The copy ready materials are a collection of the module assessments, lesson exit tickets and fluency exercises from the teacher materials.",

          "description": "In this module, students build on their understanding of probability developed in previous grades. \u00a0In Topic A the multiplication rule for independent events introduced in Algebra II is generalized to a rule that can be used to calculate probability where two events are not independent. \u00a0Students are also introduced to three techniques for counting outcomes. \u00a0Topic B presents information related to random variables and discrete probability distributions. \u00a0Topic C is a capstone topic for this module, where students use what they have learned about probability and expected value to analyze strategies and make decisions in a variety of contexts. The student materials consist of the student pages for each lesson in Module 5. The copy ready materials are a collection of the module assessments, lesson exit tickets and fluency exercises from the teacher materials.",
